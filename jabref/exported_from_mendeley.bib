abstract = {Remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a fast and cost-efficient tool for mapping and environmental monitoring. The sensors are operated at low flight altitudes, usually below 500 m above ground, leading to spatial resolutions up to the centimeter range. This type of data causes new challenges in atmospheric compensation and surface reflectance retrieval. Based on these specific boundary conditions, a new drone based atmospheric correction concept (DROACOR) is proposed, which is designed for currently available UAV based sensors. It is suited for multispectral visible/near infrared sensors as well as hyperspectral instruments covering the 400-1000&thinsp;nm spectral region or the 400-2500&thinsp;nm spectrum. The goal of the development is a fully automatic processor which dynamically adjusts to the given instrument and the atmospheric conditions. Optionally, irradiance measurements from simultaneously measured cosine receptors or from in-field reference panels can be taken into account to improve the processing quality by adjusting the irradiance parameter or by performing an in-flight vicarious calibration. Examples of DROACOR processing results are presented for a multispectral image data set and a hyperspectral data set, both acquired at variable flight altitudes. The resulting spectra show the applicability of the methods for both sensor types and an accuracy level below 2.5% reflectance units.},

abstract = {How to represent an image? While the visual world is presented in a continuous manner, machines store and see the images in a discrete way with 2D arrays of pixels. In this paper, we seek to learn a continuous representation for images. Inspired by the recent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit neural representation, we propose Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF), which takes an image coordinate and the 2D deep features around the coordinate as inputs, predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate as an output. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for images, we train an encoder with LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to ×30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided. We further show that LIIF representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 2D, it naturally supports the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths and significantly outperforms the method with resizing the ground-truths.

abstract = {R{\'{i}}a de Vigo and R{\'{i}}a de Ald{\'{a}}n have high biological richness that is reflected in the number of environmental protection areas like the Atlantic Islands National Park and five places of community interest. Benthic algal communities play an important role in these ecosystems due to their ecological functions and support a great part of this biological richness. We tested by means of bio-optical modelling and Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) images to what extent remote sensing could be used to map these communities in R{\'{i}}a de Vigo and R{\'{i}}a de Ald{\'{a}}n (NW Spain). Reflectance spectra of dominating macroalgae groups were modelled for different water depths in order to estimate the separability of different bottom types based on their spectral signatures and the spectral characteristics of the AHS. Our results indicate that separation between three macroalgae groups (green, brown and red) as well as sand is possible when the bottoms are emerged during low tide. The spectra differences decrease rapidly with increasing water depth. Two types of classifications were carried out with the three AHS images: maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Maximum likelihood showed positive results reaching overall accuracy percentages higher than 95 % and kappa coefficients higher than 0. 90 for the bottom classes: shallow sand, deep sand, emerged rock, emerged macroalgae and submerged macroalgae. Sand and algae substrates were then separately analysed with SAM. These classifications showed positive results for differentiation between green and brown macroalgae until 5 m depth and high differences between all macroalgae and sandy substrate. However, differences between red and brown macroalgae are only detectable when the algae are emerged. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Ocean Color remote sensing has a great importance in monitoring of aquatic environments. The number of optical imaging sensors onboard satellites has been increasing in the past decades, allowing to retrieve information about various water quality parameters of the world's oceans and inland waters. This is done by using various regression algorithms to retrieve water quality parameters from remotely sensed multi-spectral data for the given sensor and environment. There is a great number of such algorithms for estimating water quality parameters with different performances. Hence, choosing the most suitable model for a given purpose can be challenging. This is especially the fact for optically complex aquatic environments. In this paper, we present a concept to an Automatic Model Selection Algorithm (AMSA) aiming at determining the best model for a given matchup dataset. AMSA automatically chooses between regression models to estimate the parameter in interest. AMSA also determines the number and combination of features to use in order to obtain the best model. We show how AMSA can be built for a certain application. The example AMSA we present here is designed to estimate oceanic Chlorophyll-a for global and optically complex waters by using four Machine Learning (ML) feature ranking methods and three ML regression models. We use a synthetic and two real matchup datasets to find the best models. Finally, we use two images from optically complex waters to illustrate the predictive power of the best models. Our results indicate that AMSA has a great potential to be used for operational purposes. It can be a useful objective tool for finding the most suitable model for a given sensor, water quality parameter and environment.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral sensing, measuring reflectance over visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths, has enabled the classification and mapping of vegetation at a range of taxonomic scales, often down to the species level. Classification with hyperspectral measurements, acquired by narrow band spectroradiometers or imaging sensors, has generally required some form of spectral feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the data to a level suitable for the construction of a classification model. Despite the large number of hyperspectral plant classification studies, an in-depth review of feature selection methods and resultant waveband selections has not yet been performed. Here, we present a review of the last 22 years of hyperspectral vegetation classification literature that evaluates the overall waveband selection frequency, waveband selection frequency variation by taxonomic, structural, or functional group, and the influence of feature selection choice by comparing such methods as stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF). This review determined that all characteristics of hyperspectral plant studies influence the wavebands selected for classification. This includes the taxonomic, structural, and functional groups of the target samples, the methods, and scale at which hyperspectral measurements are recorded, as well as the feature selection method used. Furthermore, these influences do not appear to be consistent. Moreover, the considerable variability in waveband selection caused by the feature selectors effectively masks the analysis of any variability between studies related to plant groupings. Additionally, questions are raised about the suitability of SDA as a feature selection method, with it producing waveband selections at odds with the other feature selectors. Caution is recommended when choosing a feature selector for hyperspectral plant classification: We recommend multiple methods being performed. The resultant sets of selected spectral features can either be evaluated individually by multiple classification models or combined as an ensemble for evaluation by a single classifier. Additionally, we suggest caution when relying upon waveband recommendations from the literature to guide waveband selections or classifications for new plant discrimination applications, as such recommendations appear to be weakly generalizable between studies.},

abstract = {Humans are able to recognize structured relations in observation, allowing us to decompose complex scenes into simpler parts and abstract the visual world in multiple levels. However, such hierarchical reasoning ability of human perception remains largely unexplored in current literature of semantic segmentation. Existing work is often aware of flatten labels and predicts target classes exclusively for each pixel. In this paper, we instead address hierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS), which aims at structured, pixel-wise description of visual observation in terms of a class hierarchy. We devise HSSN, a general HSS framework that tackles two critical issues in this task: i) how to efficiently adapt existing hierarchy-agnostic segmentation networks to the HSS setting, and ii) how to leverage the hierarchy information to regularize HSS network learning. To address i), HSSN directly casts HSS as a pixel-wise multi-label classification task, only bringing minimal architecture change to current segmentation models. To solve ii), HSSN first explores inherent properties of the hierarchy as a training objective, which enforces segmentation predictions to obey the hierarchy structure. Further, with hierarchy-induced margin constraints, HSSNreshapes the pixel embedding space, so as to generate well-structured pixel representations and improve segmentation eventually. We conduct experiments on four semantic segmentation datasets (i.e., Mapillary Vistas 2.0, City-scapes, LIP, and PASCAL-Person-Part), with different class hierarchies, segmentation network architectures and backbones, showing the generalization and superiority of HSSN.},

abstract = {Identification of benthic megafauna is commonly based on analysis of physical samples or imagery acquired by cameras mounted on underwater platforms. Physical collection of samples is difficult, particularly from the deep sea, and identification of taxonomic morphotypes from imagery depends on resolution and investigator experience. Here, we show how an Underwater Hyperspectral Imager (UHI) can be used as an alternative in situ taxonomic tool for benthic megafauna. A UHI provides a much higher spectral resolution than standard RGB imagery, allowing marine organisms to be identified based on specific optical fingerprints. A set of reference spectra from identified organisms is established and supervised classification performed to identify benthic megafauna semi-autonomously. The UHI data provide an increased detection rate for small megafauna difficult to resolve in standard RGB imagery. In addition, seafloor anomalies with distinct spectral signatures are also detectable. In the region investigated, sediment anomalies (spectral reflectance minimum at $\sim$675 nm) unclear in RGB imagery were indicative of chlorophyll a on the seafloor. Underwater hyperspectral imaging therefore has a great potential in seafloor habitat mapping and monitoring, with areas of application ranging from shallow coastal areas to the deep sea.},

abstract = {In the epoch of the human-induced climate change, seagrasses can mitigate the resulting negative impacts due to their carbon sequestration ability. The endemic and dominant in the Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica seagrass contains the largest stocks of organic carbon among all seagrass species, yet it undergoes a significant regression in its extent. Therefore, suitable quantitative assessment of its extent and optically shallow environment are required to allow good conservation and management practices. Here, we parameterise a semi-analytical inversion model which employs above-surface remote sensing reflectance of Sentinel-2A to derive water column and bottom properties in the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece (eastern Mediterranean). In the model, the diffuse attenuation coefficients are expressed as functions of absorption and backscattering coefficients. We apply a comprehensive pre-processing workflow which includes atmospheric correction using C2RCC (Case 2 Regional CoastColour) neural network, resampling of the lower spatial resolution Sentinel-2A bands to 10m/pixel, as well as empirical derivation of water bathymetry and machine learning-based classification of the resulting bottom properties using the Support Vector Machines. SVM-based classification of benthic reflectance reveals $\sim$300 ha of P. oceanica seagrass between 2 and 16 m of depth, and yields very high producer and user accuracies of 95.3% and 99.5%, respectively. Sources of errors and uncertainties are discussed. All in all, recent advances in Earth Observation in terms of optical satellite technology, cloud computing and machine learning algorithms have created the perfect storm which could aid high spatio-temporal, large-scale seagrass habitat mapping and monitoring, allowing for its integration to the Analysis Ready Data era and ultimately enabling more efficient management and conservation in the epoch of climate change.},

abstract = {The recent development and miniaturization of hyperspectral sensors embedded in drones has allowed the acquisition of hyperspectral images with high spectral and spatial resolution. The characteristics of both the embedded sensors and drones (viewing angle, flying altitude, resolution) create opportunities to consider the use of hyperspectral imagery to map and monitor macroalgae communities. In general, the overflight of the areas to be mapped is conconmittently associated accompanied with measurements carried out in the field to acquire the spectra of previously identified objects. An alternative to these simultaneous acquisitions is to use a hyperspectral library made up of pure spectra of the different species in place, that would spare field acquisition of spectra during each flight. However, the use of such a technique requires developed appropriate procedure for testing the level of species classification that can be achieved, as well as the reproducibility of the classification over time. This study presents a novel classification approach based on the use of reflectance spectra of macroalgae acquired in controlled conditions. This overall approach developed is based on both the use of the spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm applied on first derivative hyperspectral data. The efficiency of this approach has been tested on a hyperspectral library composed of 16 macroalgae species, and its temporal reproducibility has been tested on a monthly survey of the spectral response of different macro-algae species. In addition, the classification results obtained with this new approach were also compared to the results obtained through the use of the most recent and robust procedure published. The classification obtained shows that the developed approach allows to perfectly discriminate the different phyla, whatever the period. At the species level, the classification approach is less effective when the individuals studied belong to phylogenetically close species (i.e., Fucus spiralis and Fucus serratus).},

Benthic reflectance and water optical properties are both represented by linear mixtures of endmember spectra. We combine remote measurements, prior knowledge and field data using a flexible Bayesian optimal estimation, solving for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) combination of water column properties, seafloor reflectance, and depth.

Two additional infrared channels (1240 and 1610 nm) are measured by a spot radiometer housed in the same head. The spectrometer design is based on an optically fast (F/1.8) Dyson design form coupled to a wide angle two-mirror telescope in a configuration that minimizes polarization sensitivity without the use of a depolarizer. A grating with minimum polarization sensitivity and broadband efficiency was fabricated as well as a slit assembly with black (etched) silicon surface to minimize backscatter.

abstract = {The remote-sensing reflectance R(rs) is not directly measurable, and various methodologies have been employed in its estimation. I review the radiative transfer foundations of several commonly used methods for estimating R(rs), and errors associated with estimating R(rs) by removal of surface-reflected sky radiance are evaluated using the Hydrolight radiative transfer numerical model. The dependence of the sea surface reflectance factor rho, which is not an inherent optical property of the surface, on sky conditions, wind speed, solar zenith angle, and viewing geometry is examined. If rho is not estimated accurately, significant errors can occur in the estimated R(rs) for near-zenith Sun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can give considerable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggest that a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from the Sun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. For this viewing direction, a value of rho approximately 0.028 is acceptable only for wind speeds less than 5 m s(-1). For higher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of rho as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed. If the sky is overcast, a value of rho approximately 0.028 is used at all wind speeds.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are declining worldwide as a result of the effects of multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors, including regional-scale temperature-induced coral bleaching. Such events have caused significant coral mortality, leading to an evident structural collapse of reefs and shifts in associated benthic communities. In this scenario, reasonable mapping techniques and best practices are critical to improving data collection to describe spatial and temporal patterns of coral reefs after a significant bleaching impact. Our study employed the potential of a consumer-grade drone, coupled with structure from motion and object-based image analysis to investigate for the first time a tool to monitor changes in substrate composition and the associated deterioration in reef environments in a Maldivian shallow-water coral reef. Three key substrate types (hard coral, coral rubble and sand) were detected with high accuracy on high-resolution orthomosaics collected from four sub-areas. Multi-temporal acquisition of UAV data allowed us to compare the classified maps over time (February 2017, November 2018) and obtain evidence of the relevant deterioration in structural complexity of flat reef environments that occurred after the 2016 mass bleaching event. We believe that our proposed methodology offers a cost-effective procedure that is well suited to generate maps for the long-term monitoring of changes in substrate type and reef complexity in shallow water},

abstract = {Fauna associated with the common kelp along the Norwegian coast, Laminaria hyperborea, was sampled at four sites covering 1000 km of coastline. Exploitation of the kelp habitat by the fauna, and the ways in which habitat size and seasonal variations affect the kelp fauna community were analysed. The study focused on mobile macrofauna, of which 238 species were found on 56 kelps sampled, with an average density of almost 8000 individuals per kelp. Amphipods and gastropods were the most diverse and abundant fauna groups. The species composition was different on the lamina, stipe (with epiphytic algae) and holdfast. A similar pattern of epiphyte- and holdfast-fauna composition was found for all regions. Lowest diversity and abundance were found on the lamina, and highest diversity in the holdfast. Highest abundance was found on the stipe in summer, but there were large variations between sites and seasons, from a few individuals to more than 80 000 animals per stipe. Neither seasonal changes nor variation in habitat volume affected the number of species significantly, but abundance was significantly related to season and habitat volume. These variations were most pronounced for stipe fauna. Laminaria hyperborea offers a heterogeneous habitat exploited by a diverse and abundant invertebrate community, its abundance depending on local and regional variations in kelp size.},

abstract = {Nutrient loading to coastal bay ecosystems is of a similar magnitude as that to deeper, river-fed estuaries, yet our understanding of the eutrophication process in these shallow systems lags far behind. In this synthesis, we focus on one type of biotic feedback that influences eutrophication patterns in coastal bays - the important role of primary producers in the 'coastal filter'. We discuss the 2 aspects of plant-mediated nutrient cycling as eutrophication induces a shift in primary producer dominance: (1) the fate of nutrients bound in plant biomass, and (2) the effects of primary producers on biogeochemical processes that influence nutrient retention. We suggest the following generalizations as eutrophication proceeds in coastal bays: (1) Long-term retention of recalcitrant dissolved and particulate organic matter will decline as seagrasses are replaced by algae with less refractory material. (2) Benthic grazers buffer the early effects of nutrient enrichment, but consumption rates will decline as physico-chemical conditions stress consumer populations. (3) Mass transport of plant-bound nutrients will increase because attached perennial macrophytes will be replaced by unattached ephemeral algae that move with the water. (4) Denitrification will be an unimportant sink for N because primary producers typically outcompete bacteria for available N, and partitioning of nitrate reduction will shift to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in later stages of eutrophication. In tropical/subtropical systems dominated by carbonate sediments, eutrophication will likely result in a positive feedback where increased sulfate reduction and sulfide accumulation in sediments will decrease P adsorption to Fe and enhance the release of P to the overlying water. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {Detecting and locating surface defects in textured materials is a crucial but challenging problem due to factors such as texture variations and lack of adequate defective samples prior to testing. In this paper we present a novel unsupervised method for automatically detecting defects in fabrics based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The proposed method extends the standard DCGAN, which consists of a discriminator and a generator, by introducing a new encoder component. With the assistance of this encoder, our model can reconstruct a given query image such that no defects but only normal textures will be preserved in the reconstruction. Therefore, when subtracting the reconstruction from the original image, a residual map can be created to highlight potential defective regions. Besides, our model generates a likelihood map for the image under inspection where each pixel value indicates the probability of occurrence of defects at that location. The residual map and the likelihood map are then synthesized together to form an enhanced fusion map. Typically, the fusion map exhibits uniform gray levels over defect-free regions but distinct deviations over defective areas, which can be further thresholded to produce a binarized segmentation result. Our model can be unsupervisedly trained by feeding with a set of small-sized image patches picked from a few defect-free examples. The training is divided into several successively performed stages, each under an individual training strategy. The performance of the proposed method has been extensively evaluated by a variety of real fabric samples. The experimental results in comparison with other methods demonstrate its effectiveness in fabric defect detection.},

Mapping eelgrass beds is important for coastal water and nearshore estuarine monitoring, management, and planning. This study demonstrated the possible use of high spatial (approximately 5 m) and temporal (maximum low tide) resolution airborne multispectral scanner on mapping eelgrass beds in Northern Puget Sound, Washington. A combination of supervised and unsupervised classification approaches were performed on the multispectral scanner imagery. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the red and near-infrared bands and ancillary spatial information, were used to extract and mask eelgrass beds and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the study area. We evaluated the resulting thematic map (geocoded, classified image) against a conventional aerial photograph interpretation using 260 point locations randomly stratified over five defined classes from the thematic map. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92 percent with 0.92 Kappa Coefficient in the study area. This study demonstrates that the airborne multispectral scanner can be useful for mapping eelgrass beds in a local or regional scale, especially in regions for which optical remote sensing from space is constrained by climatic and tidal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

In southeast Alaska two species of floating kelps, Nereocystis luetkeana and Alaria fistulosa, have been commercially harvested since 1992 for use as agrochemicals by the Alaska Kelp Company. However, there is currently no harvest management plan for this fishery. The lack of a formalized management plan is one factor that has kept the kelp industry from expanding in the state. We have employed an aerial digital multispectral imaging system (DMSC) calibrated with ground truthing for performing such an assessment. The system can be flown at varying altitudes to achieve spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 2 m. Rapid ground truthing techniques were developed using morphometric measurements to predict biomass. Analysis of the DMSC imagery showed that good correlations could be developed between the multispectral imagery and kelp biomass estimates collected at the ground-truth sites. Repeatable estimates of kelp bed area derived from the multispectral imagery could be made at varying tidal levels. However, broad scale maps of kelp biomass suitable for estimating harvest rates could not be made at different tide levels. Multispectral imagery suitable for this purpose must be collected at a standard tidal level.},

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community.

abstract = {The complexity and heterogeneity of shallow coastal waters over small spatial scales provides a challenging environment for mapping and monitoring benthic habitats using remote sensing imagery. Additionally, changes in coral reef community structure are occurring on unprecedented temporal scales that require large-scale synoptic coverage and monitoring of coral reefs. A variety of sensors and analyses have been employed for monitoring coral reefs: this study applied a spectrum-matching and look-up-table methodology to the analysis of hyperspectral imagery of a shallow coral reef in the Bahamas. In unconstrained retrievals the retrieved bathymetry was on average within 5% of that measured acoustically, and 92% of pixels had retrieved depths within 25% of the acoustic depth. Retrieved absorption coefficients had less than 20% errors observed at blue wavelengths. The reef scale benthic classification derived by analysis of the imagery was consistent with the percent cover of specific coral reef habitat classes obtained by conventional line transects over the reef, and the inversions were robust as the results were similar when the benthic classification retrieval was constrained by measurements of bathymetry or water column optical properties. These results support the use of calibrated hyperspectral imagery for the rapid determination of bathymetry, water optical properties, and the classification of important habitat classes common to coral reefs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Seagrasses provide a number of critical ecosystem services, including habitat for numerous species, sediment stabilization, and shoreline protection. Ariel photography is a useful tool to estimate the areal extent of seagrasses, but recent innovations in radiometrically calibrated sensors and algorithm development have allowed identification of benthic types and retrieval of absolute density. This study demonstrates the quantitative ability of a high spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral sensor (3.2 nm bandwidth) in the complex coastal waters of Saint Joseph's Bay (SJB). Several benthic types were distinguished, including submerged and floating aquatic vegetation, benthic red algae, bare sand, and optically deep water. A total of 23.6 km2 of benthic vegetation was detected, indicating no dramatic change in vegetation area over the past 30 years. SJB supported high seagrass density at depths shallower than 2 m with an average leaf area index of 2.0 ± 0.6 m2 m−2. Annual seagrass production in the bay was 13,570 t C year−1 and represented 41 % of total marine primary production. The effects of coarser spatial resolution were investigated and found to reduce biomass retrievals, underestimate productivity, and alter patch size statistics. Although data requirements for this approach are considerable, water column optical modeling may reduce the in situ requirements and facilitate the transition of this technique to routine monitoring efforts. The ability to quantify not just areal extent but also productivity of a seagrass meadow in optically complex coastal waters can provide information on the capacity of these environments to support marine food webs.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

We show that positive trends in OC in 474 streams, lakes, and rivers in boreal and subarctic ecosystems in Norway, Sweden, and Finland between 1990 and 2013 are surprisingly constant across climatic gradients and catchment sizes (median, +1.4% year–1; interquartile range, +0.8–2.0% year–1), implying that water bodies across the entire landscape are browning. The largest trends (median, +1.7% year–1) were found in regions impacted by strong reductions in sulfur deposition, while subarctic regions showed the least browning (median, +0.8% year–1).

abstract = {The use of standardised classifications, or operational definitions, is essential if different researchers are to measure and compare similar entities. In the marine realm, algal 'turfs' are increasingly reported to be globally expanding at the expense of kelps and canopy-forming algae. However, ecological research about the underlying drivers of this shift is limited by a vague and inconsistent definition of what exactly a turf is. In order to stimulate more effective descriptions of 'turfs' and facilitate communication of research outcomes and comparisons across studies, we reviewed the use of the term turf in ecological studies of temperate coasts and coral reefs and (1) identified the main types and distribution of algal assemblages known as 'turfs', (2) examined the descriptions of turfs so that we may recognise some general characteristics, including those contingent on environmental conditions; and (3) offered character descriptions that could improve communication and comparisons. These descriptors centre on reporting information on the morphology, height, density of thalli, the amount of sediment trapped in turfs and a description of the area covered by turfs, including their patchiness and persistence. Our review recognised these as common attributes that could be usefully described across a wide range of circumstances and provide insights into the ecology of turfs and their interactions with other assemblages in a community. The use of common descriptors would provide the term 'turf' with greater scientific value. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract = {Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments.},

abstract = {Around year 2000, sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) forests were observed to disappear in southern parts of Norway, being replaced by mats of turf algae (i.e., filamentous ephemeral algae) loaded with sediments. Among more than 600 stations covering 35 000 km of coastline, about 80% on the Skagerrak coast and about 40% on the North Sea coast were dominated by turf. Various types of turf algae replaced S. latissima in a discontinuous pattern. This large spatial scale event was reported as a possible irrevocable regime shift, not caused by a single factor but related to multiple stressors, where eutrophication and ocean warming were proposed to be the most important. Recent observations have however, revealed that the seabed state has flipped back and forth between sugar kelp and turf algae in several areas and on temporal scales spanning from seasons to years. The relative abundance of S. latissima at monitoring sites at the Norwegian southern coast has fluctuated dramatically during the last 12 years, varying from sparse to common at several of these sites. In 2016, sugar kelp abundance had increased in more than half of the sites, compared to earlier years. Our monitoring data as well as other field observations and field experiments question the regime shift paradigm. Although traditionally considered as a perennial macrophyte, several of our studies indicate that sugar kelp possesses many of the characteristic traits of an opportunistic species, such as high dispersal potential and colonization rate, which enables the species to rapidly colonize available substrate. However, where turf algae persist, space for recolonization of sugar kelp will most likely be minor. In this paper we explore the spatial and temporal shift dynamic between sugar kelp and turf algae based on monitoring data and other studies. Based on a synthesis of mapped fluctuations between the two states, and studies on sugar kelps recolonization abilities, we discuss prerequisites and drivers for an irrevocable regime shift or a continuation of natural fluctuations, as well as possible mitigation actions.},

abstract = {New coastal ocean remote sensing techniques permit benthic habitats to be explored with higher resolution than ever before. A mechanistic radiative transfer approach is developed that first removes the distorting influence of the water column on the remotely sensed signal to retrieve an estimate of the reflectance at the seafloor. The retrieved bottom reflectance is then used to classify the benthos. This spectrally based approach is advantageous because model components are separate and can be evaluated and modified individually for different environments. Here, we applied our approach to quantitatively estimate shallow-water bathymetry and leaf area index (LAI) of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum for a study site near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Two high-resolution images were obtained from the ocean portable hyperspectral imager for low-light spectroscopy (Ocean PHILLS) over the study site in May 1999 and 2000. A combination of in situ observations of seafloor reflectance and radiative transfer modeling was used to develop and test our algorithm. Bathymetry was mapped to meter-scale resolution using a site-specific relationship (r2 = 0.97) derived from spectral ratios of remote sensing reflectance at 555 and 670 nm. Depth-independent bottom reflectance was retrieved from remote sensing reflectance using bathymetry and tables of modeled water column attenuation coefficients. The magnitude of retrieved bottom reflectance was highly correlated to seagrass LAI measured from diver surveys at seven stations within the image (r2 = 0.88-0.98). Mapped turtlegrass LAI was remarkably stable over a 2-yr period at our study site, even though Hurricane Floyd swept over the study site in September 1999.},

Seagrass ecosystems play a multi-functional role in human well-being, e.g. food through fisheries, control of erosion and protection against floods. Quantifying these services reveals their contributions to human well-being and helps justify seagrass conservation. There has been no comprehensive assessment as to whether seagrass ecosystem services are perceived to vary over the globe or amongst genera. Our study compiles the most complete list of ecosystem services provided by seagrasses so far, including bioregional- and genus-specific information from expert opinion and published studies. Several seagrass ecosystem services vary considerably in their (known) provision across genera and over the globe. Seagrasses genera are clearly not all equal with regard to the ecosystem services they provide. As seagrass genera are not evenly distributed over all bioregions, the presence of an ecosystem service sometimes depends on the genera present. Larger sized seagrass genera (e.g. Posidonia, Enhalus) are perceived to provide more substantial and a wider variety of ecosystem services than smaller species (e.g. Halophila, Lepilaena). Nevertheless, smaller species provide important services. Our findings point out data gaps, provide new insight for more efficient management and recommend caution in economic valuation of seagrass services worldwide.},

abstract = {The fine classification of crops is critical for food security and agricultural management. There are many different species of crops, some of which have similar spectral curves. As a result, the precise classification of crops is a difficult task. Although the classification methods that incorporate spatial information can reduce the noise and improve the classification accuracy, to a certain extent, the problem is far from solved. Therefore, in this paper, the method of spatial-spectral fusion based on conditional random fields (SSF-CRF) for the fine classification of crops in UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is presented. The proposed method designs suitable potential functions in a pairwise conditional random field model, fusing the spectral and spatial features to reduce the spectral variation within the homogenous regions and accurately identify the crops. The experiments on hyperspectral datasets of the cities of Hanchuan and Honghu in China showed that, compared with the traditional methods, the proposed classification method can effectively improve the classification accuracy, protect the edges and shapes of the features, and relieve excessive smoothing, while retaining detailed information. This method has important significance for the fine classification of crops in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.},

abstract = {Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = -0.018 y-1). Our analysis identified declines in 38% of ecoregions for which there are data (-0.015 to -0.18 y-1), increases in 27% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y-1), and no detectable change in 35% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.},

abstract = {Accurate data on community structure is a priority issue in studying coastal habitats facing human pressures. The recent development of remote sensing tools has offered a ground-breaking way to collect ecological information at a very fine scale, especially using low-cost aerial photogrammetry. Although coastal mapping is carried out using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones), they can provide limited information regarding underwater benthic habitats. To achieve a precise characterisation of underwater habitat types and species assemblages, new imagery acquisition instruments become necessary to support accurate mapping programmes. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate an integrated approach based on Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric acquisition using low-cost Unmanned Aerial (UAV) and Surface (USV) Vehicles to finely map shallow benthic communities, which determine the high complexity of coastal environments. The photogrammetric outputs, including both UAV-based high (sub-meter) and USV-based ultra-high (sub-centimetre) raster products such as orthophoto mosaics and Digital Surface Models (DSMs), were classified using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach. The application of a supervised learning method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification resulted in good overall classification accuracies > 70%, proving to be a practical and feasible tool for analysing both aerial and underwater ultra-high spatial resolution imagery. The detected seabed cover classes included above and below-water key coastal features of ecological interest such as seagrass beds, “banquettes” deposits and hard bottoms. Using USV-based imagery can considerably improve the identification of specific organisms with a critical role in benthic communities, such as photophilous macroalgal beds. We conclude that the integrated use of low-cost unmanned aerial and surface vehicles and GIS processing is an effective strategy for allowing fully remote detailed data on shallow water benthic communities.},

I review the radiative transfer foundations of several commonly used methods for estimating R(rs), and errors associated with estimating R(rs) by removal of surface-reflected sky radiance are evaluated using the Hydrolight radiative transfer numerical model. The dependence of the sea surface reflectance factor rho, which is not an inherent optical property of the surface, on sky conditions, wind speed, solar zenith angle, and viewing geometry is examined. If rho is not estimated accurately, significant errors can occur in the estimated R(rs) for near-zenith Sun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can give considerable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggest that a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from the Sun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. For this viewing direction, a value of rho approximately 0.028 is acceptable only for wind speeds less than 5 m s(-1). For higher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of rho as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed. If the sky is overcast, a value of rho approximately 0.028 is used at all wind speeds.},

Inspired by the graphical structure of the human skeleton, we further propose a more powerful tree-structure based traversal method. To handle the noise and occlusion in 3D skeleton data, we introduce new gating mechanism within LSTM to learn the reliability of the sequential input data and accordingly adjust its effect on updating the long-term context information stored in the memory cell.

An instantiation of SWWAE uses a convolutional net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and employs a deconvolutional net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the reconstruction. The objective function includes reconstruction terms that induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet to be similar to those of the Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables: the "what" which are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable "where" that are fed to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder.},

abstract = {Beach litter assessments rely on time inefficient and high human cost protocols, mining the attainment of global beach litter estimates. Here we show the application of an emerging technique, the use of drones for acquisition of high-resolution beach images coupled with machine learning for their automatic processing, aimed at achieving the first national-scale beach litter survey completed by only one operator. The aerial survey had a time efficiency of 570 ± 40 m2 min−1 and the machine learning reached a mean (±SE) detection sensitivity of 59 ± 3% with high resolution images. The resulting mean (±SE) litter density on Saudi Arabian shores of the Red Sea is of 0.12 ± 0.02 litter items m−2, distributed independently of the population density in the area around the sampling station. Instead, accumulation of litter depended on the exposure of the beach to the prevailing wind and litter composition differed between islands and the main shore, where recreational activities are the major source of anthropogenic debris. A national-scale monitoring of beach litter along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, conducted by a single drone operator, shows that litter distributes according to wind exposure.},

abstract = {Intertidal macroalgal communities mark the boundary of the marine realm and are faced with many direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures. The effective and sustainable management of these resources must be underpinned by accurate, efficient and cost-effective environmental data collection. Traditional field survey methods, whilst accurate, are time-consuming and limited in the area that can be covered. Remote sensing permits large areas to be rapidly surveyed but the effectiveness of satellites and aircraft for mapping fine-scale intertidal macroalgal mapping is limited by their coarse spatial resolution and restricted operational flexibility. The rapid development of unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and sensor technology can address these issues and provide a potential alternative to established remote sensing platforms. Here, a detailed methodology is presented for the assessment of the commercially and ecologically important intertidal brown macroalga Ascophyllum nodosum using a multirotor UAV and pushbroom hyperspectral sensor. Two different classifiers, Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), were compared along with two different sources of spectral profiles, one collected in-situ with a spectral radiometer and the other derived from hyperspectral imagery. Of the classifiers compared, both trained using image-derived spectra, MLC more accurately classified A. nodosum, and other common intertidal species and substratum (Overall Accuracy (OA) 94.7%) than SAM (OA 81.1%). In addition, SAM, trained using in-situ spectra, was the least accurate of the three classifier workflows used (OA 71.4%). The low accuracy of the spectral radiometer approach was likely due to high levels of noise present in the hyperspectral data, a result of the relative instability of the UAV platform causing vibration. The accurate mapping of non-target species also highlights the applicability of this methodology for a broader range of intertidal macroalgal species and communities. This research clearly demonstrates the potential of UAV-mounted hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping the spatially and spectral complex macroalgal habitats found within the intertidal zone.},

abstract = {Science, resource management, and defense need algorithms capable of using airborne or satellite imagery to accu- rately map bathymetry, water quality, and substrate composition in optically shallow waters. Although a variety of inver- sion algorithms are available, there has been limited assessment of performance and no work has been published com- paring their accuracy and efficiency. This paper compares the absolute and relative accuracies and computational effi- ciencies of one empirical and five radiative-transfer-based published approaches applied to coastal sites at Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas and Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. These sites have published airborne hyperspectral data and field data. The assessment showed that (1) radiative-transfer–based methods were more accurate than the empirical approach for bathymetric retrieval, and the accuracies and processing times were inversely related to the complexity of the models used; (2) all inversion methods provided moderately accurate retrievals of bathymetry, water column inherent optical properties, and benthic reflectance in waters less than 13 m deep with homogeneous to heterogeneous benthic/substrate covers; (3) slightly higher accuracy retrievals were obtained from locally parameterized methods; and (4) no method compared here can be considered optimal for all situations. The results provide a guide to the conditions where each approach may be used (available image and field data and processing capability). A re-analysis of these same or additional sites with satellite hyperspectral data with lower spatial and radiometric resolution, but higher temporal resolution would be instructive to establish guidelines for repeatable regional to global scale shallow water mapping approaches.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks trained on large supervised datasets have led to impressive results in image classification and other tasks. However, well-annotated datasets can be time-consuming and expensive to collect, lending increased interest to larger but noisy datasets that are more easily obtained. In this paper, we show that deep neural networks are capable of generalizing from training data for which true labels are massively outnumbered by incorrect labels. We demonstrate remarkably high test performance after training on corrupted data from MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. For example, on MNIST we obtain test accuracy above 90 percent even after each clean training example has been diluted with 100 randomly-labeled examples. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when erroneous labels are biased towards confusing classes. We show that training in this regime requires a significant but manageable increase in dataset size that is related to the factor by which correct labels have been diluted. Finally, we provide an analysis of our results that shows how increasing noise decreases the effective batch size.},

abstract = {The impacts of human activity on coastal ecosystems are becoming increasingly evident across the world. Consequently, there is a growing need to map, monitor, and manage these regions in a sustainable manner. In this pilot study, we present what we believe to be a novel mapping technique for shallow-water seafloor habitats: Underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI) from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). A USV-based UHI survey was carried out in a sheltered bay close to Trondheim, Norway. In the survey, an area of 176 m2 was covered, and the depth of the surveyed area was approximately 1.5 m. UHI data were initially recorded at a 1-nm spectral resolution within the range of 380–800 nm, but this was reduced to 86 spectral bands between 400-700 nm (3.5-nm spectral resolution) during post-processing. The hyperspectral image acquisition was synchronized with navigation data from the USV, which permitted georeferencing and mosaicking of the imagery at a 0.5-cm spatial resolution. Six spectral classes, including coralline algae, the wrack Fucus serratus, green algal films, and invertebrates, were identified in the georeferenced imagery, and chosen as targets for support vector machine (SVM) classification. Based on confusion matrix analyses, the overall classification accuracy was estimated to be 89%–91%, which suggests that USV-based UHI may serve as a useful tool for high-resolution mapping of shallow-water habitats in the future.},

abstract = {Seaweed and seagrass communities in the northeast Atlantic have been profoundly impacted by humans, and the rate of change is accelerating rapidly due to runaway CO2 emissions and mounting pressures on coastlines associated with human population growth and increased consumption of finite resources. Here, we predict how rapid warming and acidification are likely to affect benthic flora and coastal ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic in this century, based on global evidence from the literature as interpreted by the collective knowledge of the authorship. We predict that warming will kill off kelp forests in the south and that ocean acidification will remove maerl habitat in the north. Seagrasses will proliferate, and associated epiphytes switch from calcified algae to diatoms and filamentous species. Invasive species will thrive in niches liberated by loss of native species and spread via exponential development of artificial marine structures. Combined impacts of seawater warming, ocean acidification, and increased storminess may replace structurally diverse seaweed canopies, with associated calcified and noncalcified flora, with simple habitats dominated by noncalcified, turf-forming seaweeds. In this study, predictions are made as to how rapid warming and ocean acidification are likely to affect benthic flora and coastal ecosystems of the north-east Atlantic in this century based on global evidence from the literature as interpreted by the collective knowledge of the authorship. We predict that kelp forests will die out in the south due to warming, maerl habitat lost in the north through acidification, seagrasses will proliferate, associated epiphytes will switch from calcified algae to diatoms and filamentous species, and invasive species will thrive. Thus, structurally diverse seaweed canopies with associated calcified and noncalcified flora may be replaced with simple habitats dominated by noncalcified, turf-forming seaweeds. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates state-of-the-art parametric and nonparametric approaches for the estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index, and fractional vegetation cover from space. The parametric approach involves comparison of established and generic narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) and the Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve method, which calculates the continuum spectral region sensitive to Chl. However, as not all available bands take part in these spectral algorithms, it remains unclear whether optimal estimations are achieved. Alternatively, the nonparametric approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) techniques and allows inclusion of all bands. GP builds a nonlinear regression as a linear combination of spectra mapped to a high-dimensional space. Moreover, GP provides an indication of the most contributing bands for each parameter, a weight for the most relevant spectra contained in the training data set, and a confidence estimate of the retrieval. GP has previously demonstrated to be competitive in accuracy with support vector regression and neural networks. Results from hyperspectral Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data over the Spanish Barrax test site show that GP outperformed the VIs in assessing the vegetation properties when using at least four out of the 62 bands. GP identified most contributing bands in the red and red edge and, to a lower extent, in the blue and NIR parts of the spectrum. Since the proposed GP method is able to build robust relationships between the parameter of interest and only a few bands, it is a promising approach for multispectral data as well. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {An Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) hyperspectral imager was deployed on a manned aircraft flown at 1305-m altitude to collect data over optically shallow waters in the Florida Keys with the ultimate goal of mapping water quality and benthic habitats. As a first step, we developed a practical atmospheric correction (AC) approach to derive surface remote-sensing reflectance ((Rrs) from AISA measurements using radiative transfer simulations and constraints obtained from field spectral Rrs measurements. Unlike previously published method, the AC approach removes the surface Fresnel reflection and accounts for aircraft altitude and nonzero near-infrared (NIR) reflectance through iteration over the pre-established look-up tables (LUTs) based on MODTRAN calculations. Simulations and comparison with concurrent in situRrs measurements show the feasibility of the approach in deriving surface Rrs with acceptable uncertainties. The possibility of errors in the radiometric calibration of AISA is demonstrated, although a definitive assessment cannot be made due to lack of enough concurrent in situ measurements. The need for noise reduction and the difficulty in carrying out a vicarious calibration are also discussed to help advance the design of future AISA missions.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that using spectral-spatial information can considerably improve the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. HSI data is typically presented in the format of 3D cubes. Thus, 3D spatial filtering naturally offers a simple and effective method for simultaneously extracting the spectral-spatial features within such images. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) framework is proposed for accurate HSI classification. The proposed method views the HSI cube data altogether without relying on any preprocessing or post-processing, extracting the deep spectral-spatial-combined features effectively. In addition, it requires fewer parameters than other deep learning-based methods. Thus, the model is lighter, less likely to over-fit, and easier to train. For comparison and validation, we test the proposed method along with three other deep learning-based HSI classification methods-namely, stacked autoencoder (SAE), deep brief network (DBN), and 2D-CNN-based methods-on three real-world HSI datasets captured by different sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3D-CNN-based method outperforms these state-of-the-art methods and sets a new record.},

Supervised deep learning methods are currently state of the art for many machine learning problems, but these methods require large quantities of labeled data to be effective. Unfortunately, existing labeled HSI benchmarks are too small to directly train a deep supervised network. Alternatively, we used self-taught learning, which is an unsupervised method to learn feature extracting frameworks from unlabeled hyperspectral imagery. These models learn how to extract generalizable features by training on sufficiently large quantities of unlabeled data that are distinct from the target data set. Once trained, these models can extract features from smaller labeled target data sets. We studied two self-taught learning frameworks for HSI classification. The first is a shallow approach that uses independent component analysis and the second is a three-layer stacked convolutional autoencoder. Our models are applied to the Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, and Pavia University data sets, which were captured by two separate sensors at different altitudes.

abstract = {The vast majority of published papers concerning seagrass meadows contain statements to the effect that seagrass beds serve as important nurseries for many species. We reviewed more than 200 papers that were relevant to the nursery role hypothesis. We used both vote counting and meta-analytic techniques to evaluate whether the body of previous studies that report seagrass meadows to be nursery grounds actually contain data that support this proposition. We restricted our analyses to papers that compared seagrass beds to other habitats, and examined data on a variety of well-studied species concerning their density, growth, survival and migration to adult habitat. Within this group of papers, we considered potential factors that could influence the nursery function (e.g. location, or laboratory vs field studies). We also evaluated case histories of well-documented large-scale seagrass losses on the nursery function. Major results were consistent with the expectations that abundance, growth and survival were greater in seagrass than in unstructured habitats. Abundance data also suggested that seagrass beds in the Northern Hemisphere might be more important as nursery areas than those in the Southern Hemisphere. Surprisingly, few significant differences existed in abundance, growth or survival when seagrass meadows were compared to other structured habitats, such as oyster or cobble reefs, or macroalgal beds. Nor were there decreases in harvests of commercially important species that could clearly be attributed to significant seagrass declines in 3 well-studied areas. However, there were decreased abundances of juveniles of commercially important species in these areas, suggesting a strong link between seagrass abundance and those of juvenile finfish and shellfish. One important implication of these results is that structure per se, rather than the type of structure, appears to be an important determinant of nursery value. Clearly, more rigorous studies that test all aspects of the nursery role hypothesis are clearly needed for seagrass meadows as well as other structured habitats. The results of such studies will allow better decisions to be made concerning the conservation and restoration of marine habitats.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce autoencoder ensembles for unsupervised outlier detection. One problem with neural networks is that they are sensitive to noise and often require large data sets to work robustly, while increasing data size makes them slow. As a result, there are only a few existing works in the literature on the use of neural networks in outlier detection. This paper shows that neural networks can be a very competitive technique to other existing methods. The basic idea is to randomly vary on the connectivity architecture of the autoencoder to obtain significantly better performance. Furthermore, we combine this technique with an adaptive sampling method to make our approach more efficient and effective. Experimental results comparing the proposed approach with state-of-the- art detectors are presented on several benchmark data sets showing the accuracy of our approach.},

Airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data were used. The laser scanning data was used to mask pixels with low or no vegetation in the hyperspectral data. A green–blue ratio was used to remove shadow areas from tree canopies, and the normalized difference vegetation index to remove dead vegetation and non-vegetation. The best method was hyperspectral pixel classification with 160 spectral channels in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, using a deep neural network. This method achieved 87% correct classification rate. Partial least squares regression for hyperspectral pixel classification achieved 78%. Deep neural network image classification using canopy height blended with three hyperspectral channels achieved 74%. A simple pixel classification method based on two spectral indices resulted in 67% correct classification. A possible future improvement is to find a better way to combine hyperspectral data with canopy height data in a deep neural network.},

abstract = {According to the EU Habitats directive, the Water Framework Directive, and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, member states are required to map, monitor, and evaluate changes in quality and areal distribution of different marine habitats and biotopes to protect the marine environment more effectively. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a key indicator of the ecological status of coastal ecosystems and is therefore widely used in reporting related to these directives. Environmental monitoring of the areal distribution of SAV is lacking in Sweden due to the challenges of large-scale monitoring using traditional small-scale methods. To address this gap, in 2020, we embarked on a project to combine Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, novel machine learning (ML) techniques, and advanced data processing in a cloud-based web application that enables users to create up-to-date SAV classifications. At the same time, the approach was used to derive the first high-resolution SAV map for the entire coastline of Sweden, where an area of 1550 km2 was mapped as SAV. Quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the classification using independent field data from three different regions along the Swedish coast demonstrated relative high accuracy within shallower areas, particularly where water transparency was high (average total accuracy per region 0.60–0.77). However, the classification missed large proportions of vegetation growing in deeper water (on average 31%–50%) and performed poorly in areas with fragmented or mixed vegetation and poor water quality, challenges that should be addressed in the development of the mapping methods towards integration into monitoring frameworks such as the EU directives. In this article, we present the results of the first satellite-derived SAV classification for the entire Swedish coast and show the implementation of a cloud-based SAV mapping application (prototype) developed within the frame of the project.

abstract = {Understanding how increasing human domination of the biosphere affects life on earth is a critical research challenge. This task is facilitated by the increasing availability of open-source data repositories, which allow ecologists to address scientific questions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Large datasets are mostly observational, so they may have limited ability to uncover causal relations among variables. Experiments are better suited at attributing causation, but they are often limited in scope. We propose hybrid datasets, resulting from the integration of observational with experimental data, as an approach to leverage the scope and ability to attribute causality in ecological studies. We show how the analysis of hybrid datasets with emerging techniques in time series analysis (Convergent Cross-mapping) and macroecology (Joint Species Distribution Models) can generate novel insights into causal effects of abiotic and biotic processes that would be difficult to achieve otherwise. We illustrate these principles with two case studies in marine ecosystems and discuss the potential to generalize across environments, species and ecological processes. If used wisely, the analysis of hybrid datasets may become the standard approach for research goals that seek causal explanations for large-scale ecological phenomena.},

abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy has been used successfully to map species across diverse ecosystems, and with several spaceborne imaging spectrometer missions underway (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)), these data may soon be available globally. Still, most studies have focused only on single ecosystems, and many different classification strategies have been used, making it difficult to assess the potential for mapping dominant species on a broader scale. Here we compare a number of classification approaches across five contrasting ecosystems containing an expansive diversity of species and plant functional types in an effort to find a robust strategy for discriminating among dominant plant species within and across ecosystems. We evaluated the performance of combinations of methods of training data selection (stratified random selection and iterative endmember selection (IES)), spectral dimension reduction methods (canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR)) and classification algorithms (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA)). Accuracy was assessed using an independent validation data set. Mean kappa coefficients for all strategies ranged from 0.48 to 0.85 for each ecosystem. Maximum kappa values and overall accuracies within each ecosystem ranged from 0.56 to 0.90 and 61-92%, respectively. Our findings show that both LDA and MESMA are able to discriminate among species to a high degree of accuracy in most ecosystems, with LDA performing slightly better. Spectral dimension reduction generally improved these results, particularly in conjunction with MESMA. Within each ecosystem, both the number and identities of functional types present, as well as the spatial distribution of dominant species, played a strong role in classification accuracy. In a pooled ecosystem classification, using CDA and LDA, we discriminated among 65 classes with an overall accuracy of 70% for the validation library, using only a 6% training sample. Our results suggest that a spaceborne imaging spectrometer such as HyspIRI will be able to map dominant plant species on a broader scale.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is widely used in coastal management. Lyzenga's model has been traditionally used to explain the relationship between bottom surface reflectance and the radiance level measured by satellite. Due to its central assumption, this model lacks accuracy compared with the other radiative transfer models. Nonetheless, it enables, with a single and simple equation, representation of the multiple optical processes taking place in coastal areas. Mapping processes associated with this model may include radiometric correction, a technique previously pointed out as a major driver of mapping accuracy. Radiometric correction is generally based on a depth-invariant index, efficient for clear waters (Jerlov water type I to II) but largely unsuitable when transparency decreases (Jerlov water type II to III). In order to overcome this problem, we developed a new index for radiometric correction, which combines bathymetry data with attenuation coefficients. The improved efficiency of our model with regard to the traditional depth invariant index was demonstrated through two case studies: Funakoshi Bay (Japan; Jerlov water type II) and the Gabes Gulf part located off Mahares (Tunisia; Jerlov water type II to III). {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Considered to be a challenging environment to map, this area is characterized by a diverse mix of inter- and subtidal habitat types. Our mapped distribution of seagrasses corresponded well to field data, although the total seagrass area was underestimated due to spectral confusion and misclassification of areas with sparse seagrass patches as sparse coral and algae-covered limestone rock. Seagrass biomass was also accurately estimated (r2 = 0.83), except in areas with Thalassodendron ciliatum (r2 = 0.57), as the stems of T. ciliatum change the relationship between light interception and biomass from that of other species in the area. We recommend the use of remote sensing over field-based methods for seagrass mapping because of the comprehensive coverage, high accuracy and ability to estimate biomass. The results obtained with IKONOS imagery in our complex study area are encouraging, and support the use of this data source for seagrass mapping in similar areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging is a rich source of data, allowing for a multitude of effective applications. However, such imaging remains challenging because of large data dimension and, typically, a small pool of available training examples. While deep learning approaches have been shown to be successful in providing effective classification solutions, especially for high dimensional problems, unfortunately they work best with a lot of labelled examples available. The transfer learning approach can be used to alleviate the second requirement for a particular dataset: first the network is pre-trained on some dataset with large amount of training labels available, then the actual dataset is used to fine-tune the network. This strategy is not straightforward to apply with hyperspectral images, as it is often the case that only one particular image of some type or characteristic is available. In this paper, we propose and investigate a simple and effective strategy of transfer learning that uses unsupervised pre-training step without label information. This approach can be applied to many of the hyperspectral classification problems. The performed experiments show that it is very effective at improving the classification accuracy without being restricted to a particular image type or neural network architecture. The experiments were carried out on several deep neural network architectures and various sizes of labeled training sets. The greatest improvement in overall accuracy on the Indian Pines and Pavia University datasets is over 21 and 13 percentage points, respectively. An additional advantage of the proposed approach is the unsupervised nature of the pre-training step, which can be done immediately after image acquisition, without the need of the potentially costly expert's time.},

abstract = {Along the Swedish northwest coast, over 60% of the eelgrass meadows have been lost since the 1980s. Despite improved water quality, no recovery has occurred, and restoration is presently considered to mitigate historical losses. However, the factors preventing natural recovery of eelgrass are not known, and it is not clear if conditions would allow restoration. Here, we present the results from 5 years of field studies with the aim of identifying the key processes affecting eelgrass growth and survival at historical eelgrass areas. Continuous light measurements and comparison with historic eelgrass distribution indicate that maximum depth distribution has decreased locally with 1.5–2.3 m in areas that have lost large eelgrass beds in the last 10–30 years. Field studies suggest that wind-driven local resuspension of sediments that are no longer stabilized by eelgrass beds is the main cause behind the deteriorated light conditions. Field experiments show that a combination of low light condition and disturbance from drifting algal mats prevents eelgrass recovery in these areas, whereas the sulfide intrusion from the sediment and dislodgement of shoots by waves had little effect on growth and survival. These results suggest that local regime shifts acting on a scale of 40–200 ha have occurred after the loss of eelgrass beds, where increased sediment resuspension and proliferation of drifting algal mats act as feedback mechanisms that prevent both natural recovery and restoration of eelgrass. The feedbacks appear to be interacting and causing an accelerating loss of eelgrass that is presently spreading to neighboring areas.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Skin cancers are classified as nonmelanoma and melanoma, with the first type being the most frequent and the second type being the most deadly. The key to effective treatment of skin cancer is early detection. With the recent increase of computational power, the number of algorithms to detect and classify skin lesions has increased. The overall verdict on systems based on clinical and dermoscopic images captured with conventional RGB (red, green, and blue) cameras is that they do not outperform dermatologists. Computer-based systems based on conventional RGB images seem to have reached an upper limit in their performance, while emerging technologies such as hyperspectral and multispectral imaging might possibly improve the results. These types of images can explore spectral regions beyond the human eye capabilities. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction are crucial parts of extracting salient information from this type of data. It is necessary to extend current classification methodologies to use all of the spatiospectral information, and deep learning models should be explored since they are capable of learning robust feature detectors from data. There is a lack of large, high-quality datasets of hyperspectral skin lesion images, and there is a need for tools that can aid with monitoring the evolution of skin lesions over time. To understand the rich information contained in hyperspectral images, further research using data science and statistical methodologies, such as functional data analysis, scale-space theory, machine learning, and so on, are essential. This article is categorized under: Applications of Computational Statistics > Health and Medical Data/Informatics.},

abstract = {As a powerful visual model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various visual recognition problems, and attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, due to the highly correlated bands and insufficient training samples of hyperspectral image data, it still remains a challenging problem to effectively apply the CNN models on hyperspectral images. In this paper, an efficient CNN architecture has been proposed to boost its discriminative capability for hyperspectral image classification, in which the original data is used as the input and the final CNN outputs are the predicted class-related results. The proposed CNN infrastructure has several distinct advantages. Firstly, different from traditional classification methods those need hand-crafted features, the CNN model used here is designed to deal with the problem of hyperspectral image analysis in an end-to-end way. Secondly, the parameters of the CNN model are optimized from a small training set, while the over-fitting problem of the neural network has been alleviated to some extent. Finally, in order to better deal with the hyperspectral image information, 1 × 1 convolutional layers have been adopted, and an average pooling layer and larger dropout rates have also been employed in the whole CNN procedure. The experiments on three benchmark data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CNN architecture considerably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Coral reef benthic communities are mosaics of individual bottom-types that are distinguished by their taxonomic composition and functional roles in the ecosystem. Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13,100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 m. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates two alternative regression techniques for oceanic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content estimation. One of the investigated methodologies is the recently introduced Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. We explore two feature ranking methods derived for the GPR model, namely sensitivity analysis (SA) and automatic relevance determination (ARD). We also investigate a second regression method, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) for oceanic Chl-a content estimation. Feature relevance in the PLSR model can be accessed through the variable importance in projection (VIP) feature ranking algorithm. This paper thus analyzes three feature ranking models, SA, ARD, and VIP, which are all derived from different fundamental principles, and uses the ranked features as inputs to the GPR and PLSR to assess regression strengths. We compare the regression performances using some common performance measures, and show how the feature ranking methods can be used to find the lowest number of features to estimate oceanic Chl-a content by using the GPR and PLSR models, while still producing comparable performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms. We evaluate the models on a global MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer matchup dataset. Our results show that the GPR model has the best regression performance for most of the input feature sets we used, and our conclusion is this model can favorably be used for Chl-a content retrieval, already with two features, ranked by either the SA or ARD methods.},

abstract = {Floating mats of vegetation serve to transfer biomass, nutrients and energy across marine habitats and alter the spectral properties of the sea surface. Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630. nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3. days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8. days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5. days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990. nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35. m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60. m. pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity.},

Seagrass habitats support a variety of ecosystem functions and an increasing interest has emerged for utilizing remote sensing to acquire information on the spatial extent and abundance of seagrass vegetation. Here we report on hyperspectral data collected from a combined laboratory and field-based study to examine the spectral qualities of seagrass species and evaluate whether seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover could be distinguished using true in situ hyperspectral data collected by a spectrometer overlying sea-grass-dominated vegetation in a shallow water setting in the central west coast of Florida. We also analyzed hyperspectral data measured in the lab to compare with those from in situ collections. Using a set of 97 field measurements we compared spectra qualities for different seagrass species, levels of seagrass cover, water depths, and substrate types over wavelengths 400-800 nm, using spectral data preprocessing and data transformation. Optimal wavelengths for identifying seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover were determined by two-sample t-tests. We also utilized principal component analysis (PCA) on spectra to evaluate if a set of first five PCs could be used to discriminate effectively among seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover. The experimental results indicate that the best accuracies for identifying species were produced with the data set of the second -derivative normalized spectra. The optimal wavelengths were 450, 500, 520, 550, 600, 620, 680, and 700 nm, most of which are related to the peaks of reflectance and absorption bands by photosynthetic and accessory pigments. A set of five optimal bands produced higher accuracies for identifying seagrass species (overall accuracy = 73% and average accuracy = 75%) compared with those from use of PCA. Data preprocessing techniques were demonstrated to be effective for improving discriminant accuracies of species and levels of seagrass cover. {\textcopyright} Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2012.},

abstract = {Above-surface radiance observations of water need to be corrected for reflections on the surface to derive reflectance. The three-component glint model (3C) [ Opt. Express 25 , A742 ( 2017 ) OPEXFF 1094-4087 10.1364/OE.25.0000A1 ] was developed to spectrally resolve contributions of sky and sun glint to the surface-reflected radiance signal L r ( $\lambda$ ) , and for observations recorded at high wind speed and with fixed-position measurement geometries that frequently lead to significant sun glint contributions. Performance and limitations of 3C are assessed for all relevant wind speeds, clear sky atmospheric conditions, illumination/viewing geometries, and sun glint contamination levels. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of L r ( $\lambda$ ) spectra was simulated with a spectrally resolved sky radiance distribution model and Cox–Munk wave slope statistics. Reflectances were also derived from an extensive four-year data set of continuous above-surface hyperspectral observations from the Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory, allowing to corroborate 3C processing results from simulations and measurements with regard to sky and sun glint contributions. Simulation- and measurement-derived L r ( $\lambda$ ) independently indicate that spectral dependencies of the sky light distribution and sun glint contributions may not be neglected for observations recorded at wind speeds exceeding 4 m / s , even for sun glint-minimizing measurement geometries (Sun-sensor azimuth angle $\Delta$ ϕ = 90 − 135 ° ). These findings are in accordance with current measurement protocols for satellite calibration/validation activities. In addition, it is demonstrated that 3C is able to reliably derive water reflectance for wind speeds up to 8 m/s and $\Delta$ ϕ > 20 ° .},

abstract = {A passive method for remote sensing of the nuisance green algae Cladophora glomerata in rivers is presented using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Included are methods for UAV operation, lens distortion correction, image georeferencing, and spectral analysis to support algal cover mapping. Eighteen aerial photography missions were conducted over the summer of 2013 using an off-the-shelf UAV and three-band,  wide-angle, red, green, and blue (RGB) digital camera sensor. Images were post-processed, mosaicked, and georeferenced so automated classification and mapping could be completed. An adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm were used to complete the algal identification. Digital analysis of optical imagery correctly identified filamentous algae and background coverage 90% and 92% of the time, and tau coefficients were 0.82 and 0.84 for ACE and SAM, respectively. Thereafter, algal cover was characterized for a one-kilometer channel segment during each of the 18 UAV flights. Percent cover ranged from <5% to >50%, and increased immediately after vernal freshet, peaked in midsummer, and declined in the fall. Results indicate that optical remote sensing with UAV holds promise for completing spatially precise, and multi-temporal measurements of algae or submerged aquatic vegetation in shallow rivers with low turbidity and good optical transmission.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {PCA is a classical statistical technique whose simplicity and maturity has seen it find widespread use for anomaly detection. However, it is limited in this regard by being sensitive to gross perturbations of the input, and by seeking a linear subspace that captures normal behaviour. The first issue has been dealt with by robust PCA, a variant of PCA that explicitly allows for some data points to be arbitrarily corrupted; however, this does not resolve the second issue, and indeed introduces the new issue that one can no longer inductively find anomalies on a test set. This paper addresses both issues in a single model, the robust autoencoder. This method learns a nonlinear subspace that captures the majority of data points, while allowing for some data to have arbitrary corruption. The model is simple to train and leverages recent advances in the optimisation of deep neural networks. Experiments on a range of real-world datasets highlight the model's effectiveness.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been studied from the leaf to patch (100m2) scales. However, landscape scale (>100km2) seagrass population dynamics are unresolved in seagrass ecology. Previous remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal or spatial resolution, or ecologically appropriate mapping, to fully address this issue. This paper presents a robust, semi-automated object-based image analysis approach for mapping dominant seagrass species, percentage cover and above ground biomass using a time series of field data and coincident high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The study area was a 142km2 shallow, clear water seagrass habitat (the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Australia). Nine data sets acquired between 2004 and 2013 were used to create seagrass species and percentage cover maps through the integration of seagrass photo transect field data, and atmospherically and geometrically corrected high spatial resolution satellite image data (WorldView-2, IKONOS and Quickbird-2) using an object based image analysis approach. Biomass maps were derived using empirical models trained with in-situ above ground biomass data per seagrass species. Maps and summary plots identified inter- and intra-annual variation of seagrass species composition, percentage cover level and above ground biomass. The methods provide a rigorous approach for field and image data collection and pre-processing, a semi-automated approach to extract seagrass species and cover maps and assess accuracy, and the subsequent empirical modelling of seagrass biomass. The resultant maps provide a fundamental data set for understanding landscape scale seagrass dynamics in a shallow water environment. Our findings provide proof of concept for the use of time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products for use in seagrass ecology and management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

These applications include precision agriculture, manufacturing process monitoring, mineral and petroleum exploration, environmental management, disaster mitigation, defense intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance for threat detection and identification, as well as a host of applications within the bio-medical field. Application-specific algorithms are continuously being developed to support the world-wide expanding use of HSI. Corning Incorporated has been developing and manufacturing HSI sensors, sensor systems, and sensor optical engines, as well as HSI sensor components such as gratings and slits for over a decade and a half. Corning's gratings include UV to IR spectral coverage, multiple glass, metallic, and non-metallic substrates, substrate figures from plane to spherical, to biconic aspheres, application optimized groove profiles from triangular to dual blaze to phase stepped, and groove periods from regular to chirped to aberration correcting. This depth of experience and technological breadth has allowed Corning to design and develop unique HSI spectrographs with an unprecedented combination of high performance, low cost and low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). These sensors and sensor systems are offered with wavelength coverage ranges from the visible to the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR). The extremely low SWaP of Corning HSI sensors and sensor systems enables their deployment using limited payload platforms such as small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or human hands. Mobile applications are also facilitated by Corning's built-in miniature scanner that works seamlessly with a compact push-broom HSI sensor using Corning proprietary software to collect complete data cubes. This paper discusses proprietary designs of Corning HSI sensors and systems, as well as the inhouse manufacturing capabilities that enable the cost-effective fabrication of these sensors. Specific designs of Corning HSI visNIR, SWIR and uncooled LWIR systems are presented along with salient performance characteristics. We also discuss the use of Corning HSI sensor systems for real-world applications. &copy; 2015 SPIE.},

Through field sampling, we identified several sea urchin predators and investigated their predation rates on recently settled S. droebachiensis in laboratory experiments. Tethering experiments in kelp forest and on barren ground study sites in the area where sea urchin populations are collapsing confirmed predation by some of the predators tested in laboratory experiments. The edible crab Cancer pagurus was the most efficient sea urchin predator, and it was more abundant at kelp forest sites than on barren grounds. Stocks of C. pagurus have increased dramatically in central Norway since the 1990s, and predation by C. pagurus may contribute to the decline in sea urchin densities, allowing kelp recovery and conferring resilience of the new kelp forest state. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract = {Monitoring of intertidal reefs is traditionally undertaken by on-ground survey methods which have assisted in understanding these complex habitats; however, often only a small spatial footprint of the reef is observed. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide new opportunities for monitoring broad scale coastal ecosystems through the ability to capture centimetre resolution imagery and topographic data not possible with conventional approaches. This study compares UAV remote sensing of intertidal reefs to traditional on-ground monitoring surveys, and investigates the role of UAV derived geomorphological variables in explaining observed intertidal algal and invertebrate assemblages. A multirotor UAV was used to capture <1 cm resolution data from intertidal reefs, with on-ground quadrat surveys of intertidal biotic data for comparison. UAV surveys provided reliable estimates of dominant canopy-forming algae, however, understorey species were obscured and often underestimated. UAV derived geomorphic variables showed elevation and distance to seaward reef edge explained 19.7% and 15.9% of the variation in algal and invertebrate assemblage structure respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate benefits of low-cost UAVs for intertidal monitoring through rapid data collection, full coverage census, identification of dominant canopy habitat and generation of geomorphic derivatives for explaining biological variation.},

abstract = {With almost limitless applications across marine and freshwater environments, the number of people using, and wanting to use, remotely piloted aircraft systems (or drones) is increasing exponentially. However, successfully using drones for data collection and mapping is often preceded by hours of researching drone capabilities and functionality followed by numerous limited-success flights as users tailor their approach to data collection through trial and error. Working over water can be particularly complex and the published research using drones rarely documents the methodology and practical information in sufficient detail to allow others, with little remote pilot experience, to replicate them or to learn from their mistakes. This can be frustrating and expensive, particularly when working in remote locations where the window of access is small. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical guide to drone-based data acquisition considerations. We hope to minimise the amount of trial and error required to obtain high-quality, map-ready data by outlining the principles and practice of data collection using drones, particularly in marine and freshwater environments. Importantly, our recommendations are grounded in remote sensing and photogrammetry theory so that the data collected are appropriate for making measurements and conducting quantitative data analysis.},

The imaging system works based on a built-in RGB camera and flashlight on the smartphone. We apply Wiener estimation to transform the acquired RGB-mode images into “pseudo”-hyperspectral images with 16 wavebands, covering a visible range from 470nm to 620nm. The processing method uses weighted subtractions between wavebands to extract absorption information caused by specific chromophores within skin tissue, mainly including hemoglobin and melanin. Based on the extracted absorption information of hemoglobin, we conduct real-time monitoring experiments in the skin to measure heart rate and to observe skin activities during a vascular occlusion event. Compared with expensive hyperspectral imaging systems, the smartphone-based system delivers similar results but with very-high imaging resolution. Besides, it is easy to operate, very cost-effective and has a wider customer base. The use of an unmodified smartphone to realize hyperspectral imaging promises a possibility to bring a hyperspectral analysis of skin out from laboratory and clinical wards to daily life, which may also impact on healthcare in low resource settings and rural areas.},

In this paper, we propose a method for remotely-sensed image classification by using sparse representation of deep learning features. Specifically, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract deep features from high levels of the image data. Deep features provide high level spatial information created by hierarchical structures. Although the deep features may have high dimensionality, they lie in class-dependent sub-spaces or sub-manifolds. We investigate the characteristics of deep features by using a sparse representation classification framework. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method exploits the inherent low-dimensional structure of the deep features to provide better classification results as compared to the results obtained by widely-used feature exploration algorithms, such as the extended morphological attribute profiles (EMAPs) and sparse coding (SC).},

However, with the ever-expanding inventories of both data and deep neural network models, it can be confusing to know how to choose. Most models expect input as conventional RGB format, but that can be extended to incorporate multi-sensor data. In this study, we re-implement and modify three deep neural network models of various complexities, namely UNET, DeepLabv3+ and Dense Dilated Convolutions Merging Network to use both RGB and near infrared (NIR) data from a multi-sensor UAV dataset over a Norwegian coastal area. The dataset has been carefully annotated by marine experts for coastal habitats. We find that the NIR channel increases UNET performance significantly but has mixed effects on DeepLabv3+ and DDCM. The latter two are capable of achieving best performance with RGB-only. The class-wise evaluation shows that the NIR channel greatly increases the performance in UNET for green, red algae, vegetation and rock. However, the purpose of the study is not to merely compare the models or to achieve the best performance, but to gain more insights on the compatibility between various models and data types. And as there is an ongoing effort in acquiring and annotating more data, we aim to include them in the coming year.},

abstract = {Estuaries and coasts are among the most productive ecosystems and constitute valuable habitats for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z.noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z.noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z. noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.},

This paper presents a novel digital sensor simulator for the pushbroom Offner hyperspectral imaging spectrometer, which is widely used in the hyperspectral remote sensing. Based on the imaging process, the sensor simulator consists of a spatial response module, a spectral response module, and a radiometric response module. In order to enhance the simulation accuracy, spatial interpolation-resampling, which is implemented before the spatial degradation, is developed to compromise the direction error and the extra aliasing effect. Instead of using the spectral response function (SRF), the dispersive imaging characteristics of the Offner convex grating optical system is accurately modeled by its configuration parameters. The non-uniformity characteristics, such as keystone and smile effects, are simulated in the corresponding modules. In this work, the spatial, spectral and radiometric calibration processes are simulated to provide the parameters of modulation transfer function (MTF), SRF and radiometric calibration parameters of the sensor simulator. Some uncertainty factors (the stability, band width of the monochromator for the spectral calibration, and the integrating sphere uncertainty for the radiometric calibration) are considered in the simulation of the calibration process. With the calibration parameters, several experiments were designed to validate the spatial, spectral and radiometric response of the sensor simulator, respectively. The experiment results indicate that the sensor simulator is valid.},

abstract = {The eelgrass Zostera marina is a dominant, subtidal meadow-forming seagrass in temperate regions in the northern hemisphere. Due to the numerous ecological services they provide, seagrass systems rank amongst the most valuable ecosystems worldwide but there is a lack of data regarding the structure and productivity of Irish seagrass populations. To address this gap, this investigation assessed temporal changes and depth acclimations of vegetative parameters, such as, shoot length and weight, shoot density, seagrass cover and below- and above-ground biomass, in three near-pristine subtidal Z. marina meadows in western Ireland. Most parameters revealed a marked temporal pattern, displaying clear unimodal responses, with peaks attained in July, intermediate values in April and November, and lowest values observed in January. Moreover, eelgrass cover and density decreased from 76.1 ± 6.5% in shallow meadows to 34 ± 4.5% at greater depths; inversely, other parameters such as shoot biomass or shoot length increased 2–3-fold with depth. Furthermore, annual leaf formation rates and above-ground biomass were estimated and compared to those of eelgrass populations from different latitudes (28°–66°) reported in the literature. Results suggest that the vegetative development of Irish populations corresponds to global data reported at different local and global scales of Z. marina populations inhabiting stable environments; our data serve as a first baseline for the assessment of potential future environmental impacts, including climate change and eutrophication.},

abstract = {An atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed for the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) imagery over optically shallow waters in Sugarloaf Key of the Florida Keys. The AISA data were collected repeatedly during several days in May 2012, October 2012, and May 2013. Non-zero near-infrared (NIR) remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) was accounted for through iterations, based on the relationship of field-measured Rrs between the NIR and red wavelengths. Validation showed mean ratios of 0.94–1.002 between AISA-retrieved and in situ Rrs in the blue to red wavelengths, with uncertainties generally <0.003 sr–1. Such an approach led to observations of short-term changes in AISA-retrieved Rrs from repeated measurements over waters with bottom types of seagrass meadow, sand, and patch reef. Some of these changes are larger than twofold the Rrs uncertainties from AISA retrievals, therefore representing statistically significant changes that can be well observed from airborne measurements. Through radiative transfer modelling, we demonstrated that short-term Rrs changes within 1 hour resulted primarily from sediment resuspension, while tides played a relatively minor role due to the small variation in tidal heights. A sensitivity analysis indicated that although Rrs generally increases with decreasing tide height but increasing suspended sediments, more changes were observed over sandy bottom than over seagrass. The case study suggests that repeated airborne measurements may be used to study short-term changes in shallow-water environments, and such a capacity may be enhanced with future geostationary satellite missions specifically designed to observe coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. To date, few studies have evaluated the efficiency of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) for characterizing aquatic plants. Here we evaluate the use of in situ hyperspectral data and hyperspectral VIs for distinguishing among seagrass species and levels of percentage submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover in a subtropical shallow water setting. Analysis procedures include (1) retrieving bottom reflectance, (2) calculating correlation matrices of VIs with %SAV cover and F value matrices from analysis of variance among species, (3) testing the difference of VIs between levels of %SAV cover and between species, and (4) discriminating levels of %SAV cover and species by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART) classifiers with selected VIs as input. The experimental results indicated that (1) the best VIs for discriminating the four levels of %SAV cover were simple ratio (SR) VI, normalized difference VI (NDVI), modified simple ratio VI, and NDVI × SR, whereas the best VIs for distinguishing the three seagrass species included the weighted difference VI, soil-adjusted VI (SAVI), SAVI × SR and transformed SAVI; (2) the optimal central wavelengths for constructing the best VIs were 460, 500, 610, 640, 660, and 690 nm with spectral regions ranging from 3 to 20 nm at band width 3 nm, most of which were associated with absorption bands by photosynthetic and other accessory pigments in the visible spectral range. Compared with LDA, CART performed better in discriminating the four levels of %SAV cover and identifying the three seagrass species.},

The anomalies manifest themselves in the form of over 70 different types of defects such as scratches, dents, contaminations, and various structural changes. In addition, we provide pixel-precise ground truth regions for all anomalies. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods based on deep architectures such as convolutional autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and feature descriptors using pre-trained convolutional neural networks, as well as classical computer vision methods. This initial benchmark indicates that there is considerable room for improvement.

This has led to a situation in which mistakes are less likely to be made than before, but are equally likely to be absurd or catastrophic when they do occur. Past works have recognised and tried to address this issue of mistake severity, often by using graph distances in class hierarchies, but this has largely been neglected since the advent of the current deep learning era in computer vision. In this paper, we aim to renew interest in this problem by reviewing past approaches and proposing two simple modifications of the cross-entropy loss which outperform the prior art under several metrics on two large datasets with complex class hierarchies: tieredImageNet and iNaturalist'19.},

Photosynthesis versus irradiance curves were measured at seven temperatures (0°C-30°C) by all three approaches. The maximum photosynthetic rate (PCmax) was strongly stimulated by temperature, reached an optimum for Pro. minimum only (20°C-25°C), and showed a similar relative temperature response for the three applied methods, with Q10 ranging from 1.7 to 3.5. The maximum light utilization coefficient ($\alpha$C) was insensitive or decreased slightly with increasing temperature. Absolute rates of O2 production were calculated from pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry measurements in combination with biooptical determination of absorbed quanta in PSII. The relationship between PAM-based O2 production and measured O 2 production and 14C assimilation showed a species-specific correlation, with 1.2-3.3 times higher absolute values of PCmax and $\alpha$C when calculated from PAM data for Pry. parvum and Ph. tricornutum but equivalent for Pro. minimum. The offset seemed to be temperature insensitive and could be explained by a lower quantum yield for O2 production than the theoretical maximum (due to Mehler-type reactions). Conclusively, the PAM technique can be used to study temperature responses of photosynthesis in microalgae when paying attention to the absorption properties in PSII. {\textcopyright} 2008 Phycological Society of America.},

As macroalgae accumulate heavy metals, arsenic, cadmium and mercury were also analyzed. RESULTS: Proteins ranged from 34 to 123gkg-1 dry weight (DW) and the essential amino acid levels may cover both human and salmonid requirements. Lipids were low (6-58gkg-1 DW), but the red algae had high relative content of long-chained omega-3 fatty acids (32-34 % of the fatty acids). Iodine contents were particularly high in the Laminaria species. Of the heavy metals only arsenic levels may be of concern. CONCLUSION: In total, the red alga P. palmata was regarded as the best alternative to cereals in food and feed. For several of the other species, single-component extraction for the ingredients market may be better than using the whole product.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral systems can acquire hyperspectral imagery with a high spatial resolution (which we refer to here as H2 imagery). As a result of the low operating cost, high flexibility, and the ability to achieve real-time data acquisition, UAV-borne hyperspectral systems have become an important data source for remote sensing based agricultural monitoring. However, precise crop classification based on UAV-borne H2 imagery is a challenging task when faced with a number of different crop classes. The traditional hyperspectral classification methods, such as the spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods, have difficulty in classifying H2 imagery, faced with the problems of salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and scale selection. In this article, the deep convolutional neural network with a conditional random field classifier (CNNCRF) framework is proposed for precise crop classification with UAV-borne H2 imagery. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model further incorporates the spatial-contextual information to improve the problem of holes and isolated regions in the classification map. Meanwhile, virtual sample augmentation based on the hyperspectral imaging mechanism is used to lessen the issue of the limited labeled samples. To validate the results, a new dataset—the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset—has been built for precise crop classification. The experimental results obtained using the WHU-Hi dataset confirm the accuracy and visualization performance of the proposed CNNCRF classification method, which outperforms the previous methods. In addition, the WHU-Hi dataset could serve as a benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification studies.},

abstract = {New coastal ocean remote sensing techniques permit benthic habitats to be explored with higher resolution than ever before. A mechanistic radiative transfer approach is developed that first removes the distorting influence of the water column on the remotely sensed signal to retrieve an estimate of the reflectance at the seafloor. The retrieved bottom reflectance is then used to classify the benthos. This spectrally based approach is advantageous because model components are separate and can be evaluated and modified individually for different environments. Here, we applied our approach to quantitatively estimate shallow-water bathymetry and leaf area index (LAI) of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum for a study site near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Two high-resolution images were obtained from the ocean portable hyperspectral imager for low-light spectroscopy (Ocean PHILLS) over the study site in May 1999 and 2000. A combination of in situ observations of seafloor reflectance and radiative transfer modeling was used to develop and test our algorithm. Bathymetry was mapped to meter-scale resolution using a site-specific relationship (r2 = 0.97) derived from spectral ratios of remote sensing reflectance at 555 and 670 nm. Depth-independent bottom reflectance was retrieved from remote sensing reflectance using bathymetry and tables of modeled water column attenuation coefficients. The magnitude of retrieved bottom reflectance was highly correlated to seagrass LAI measured from diver surveys at seven stations within the image (r2 = 0.88-0.98). Mapped turtlegrass LAI was remarkably stable over a 2-yr period at our study site, even though Hurricane Floyd swept over the study site in September 1999.},

abstract = {Habitat-forming seaweeds are vital components of marine ecosystems, supporting immense diversity and providing ecosystem services. Reports of major changes in the distribution and abundance of large brown seaweeds in the north-east Atlantic are an increasing cause for concern, but a lack of consistent monitoring over time is a key impediment in obtaining reliable evidence of change. There is an urgent need to recognize change rapidly and efficiently in marine communities, which are increasingly affected by pressures of human population growth, climate change, and ocean acidification. Here, the potential for remote monitoring of seaweed habitats is investigated using freely available, high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Three sources of imagery were used: (i) Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO) aerial imagery; (ii) aerial images from the Bing webmap server; and (iii) RapidEye multispectral satellite data. The study area, the Thanet Coast, is an area of chalk outcrop in south-east England of high conservation status, and includes three Marine Conservation Zones. Eight habitat classes, including brown, red, and green algal zones, were recognized based on ground-truthing surveys. A multi-class classification model was developed to predict habitat classes based on the chromatic signature derived from the aerial images. The model based on the high-resolution CCO imagery gave the best outcome (with a kappa value of 0.89). Comparing predictions for images in 2001 and 2013 revealed habitat changes, but it is unclear as to what extent these are natural variability or real trends. This study demonstrates the potential value for long-term monitoring with remote-sensing data. Repeated, standardized coastal aerial imaging surveys, such as those performed by CCO, permit the rapid assessment and re-assessment of habitat extent and change. This is of value to the conservation management of protected areas, particularly those defined by the presence or extent of specific habitats.},

abstract = {Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an interesting and promising area of research, with a very high and direct impact on the application domain of visual inspection. Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately 25–30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.},

In more recent time, HSI has started to be adopted for commercial applications in machine vision, conservation, resource exploration, and precision agriculture, to name just a few of the economically viable uses for the technology. Corning Incorporated (Corning) has been developing and manufacturing HSI sensors, sensor systems, and sensor optical engines, as well as HSI sensor components such as gratings and slits for over a decade and a half. This depth of experience and technological breadth has allowed Corning to design and develop unique HSI spectrometers with an unprecedented combination of high performance, low cost and low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). These sensors and sensor systems are offered with wavelength coverage ranges from the visible to the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR). The extremely low SWaP of Corning's HSI sensors and sensor systems enables their deployment using limited payload platforms such as small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper discusses use of the Corning patented monolithic design Offner spectrometer, the microHSI™, to build a highly compact 400-1000 nm HSI sensor in combination with a small Inertial Navigation System (INS) and micro-computer to make a complete turn-key airborne remote sensing payload. This Selectable Hyperspectral Airborne Remote sensing Kit (SHARK) has industry leading SWaP (1.5 lbs) at a disruptively low price due, in large part, to Corning's ability to manufacture the monolithic spectrometer out of polymers (i.e. plastic) and therefore reduce manufacturing costs considerably. The other factor in lowering costs is Corning's well established in house manufacturing capability in optical components and sensors that further enable cost-effective fabrication. The competitive SWaP and low cost of the microHSI™ sensor is approaching, and in some cases less than the price point of Multi Spectral Imaging (MSI) sensors. Specific designs of the Corning microHSI™ SHARK visNIR turn-key system are presented along with salient performance characteristics. Initial focus market areas include precision agriculture and historic and recent microHSI™ SHARK prototype test results are presented.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing inversion models utilize spectral information over optically shallow waters to retrieve optical properties of the water column, bottom depth and reflectance, with the latter used in benthic classification. Accuracy of these retrievals is dependent on the spectral endmember(s) used to model the bottom reflectance during the inversion. Without prior knowledge of these endmember(s) current approaches must iterate through a list of endmember-a computationally demanding task. To address this, a novel lookup table classification approach termed HOPE-LUT was developed for selecting the likely benthic endmembers of any hyperspectral image pixel. HOPE-LUT classifies a pixel as sand, mixture or non-sand, then the latter two are resolved into the three most likely classes. Optimization subsequently selects the class (out of the three) that generated the best fit to the remote sensing reflectance. For a coral reef case, modeling results indicate very high benthic classification accuracy (> 90%) for depths less than 4 m of common coral reef benthos. These accuracies decrease substantially with increasing depth due to the loss of bottom information, especially the spectral signatures. We applied this technique to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef and generated benthic habitat maps with higher classification accuracy compared to standard inversion models.},

abstract = {This article is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the l1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well.We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Currently a new underwater hyperspectral imager (UHI) have been deployed on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) for a more automated identification, mapping and monitoring of bio-geo-chemical objects of interest (OOI). Sea floor maps based on UHI can be used to classify 001 based on specific optical fingerprints providing spectral upwelling radiance or reflectance with up to 1 nm spectral resolution in the visible range for each image pixel. Different habitats comprising soft bottom, deep and cold water coral reefs, sponge habitats, pipeline monitoring and kelp forest maps are examples for UHI-based mapping. Characterising material surface on man-made objects such as corrosion on pipelines and subsea structures and archaeological objects are other examples. The overall image quality and identification success of OOI can be optimized if movements of the ROV is controlled by a dynamic position (DP) system and corresponding speed, altitude, pitch, roll and yaw control. Likewise, illumination control is important to provide proper light intensity, spectral composition and illumination evenness of OOI to enhance data quality. The benefits of using UHI for seafloor habitat mapping can be evaluated by four categories of resolution. These are A) spatial resolution (image pixel size), B) spectral resolution (1-10 nm, 400-800 nm), C) radiometric resolution (dynamic range, bits per pixel), and D) temporal resolution for time-series and monitoring. These categories of resolution are discussed with respect to OOI identification and mapping using different case examples.},

abstract = {Classification is one of the most popular topics in hyperspectral remote sensing. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods were proposed to deal with the hyperspectral data classification problem. However, most of them do not hierarchically extract deep features. In this paper, the concept of deep learning is introduced into hyperspectral data classification for the first time. First, we verify the eligibility of stacked autoencoders by following classical spectral information-based classification. Second, a new way of classifying with spatial-dominated information is proposed. We then propose a novel deep learning framework to merge the two features, from which we can get the highest classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principle component analysis (PCA), deep learning architecture, and logistic regression. Specifically, as a deep learning architecture, stacked autoencoders are aimed to get useful high-level features. Experimental results with widely-used hyperspectral data indicate that classifiers built in this deep learning-based framework provide competitive performance. In addition, the proposed joint spectral-spatial deep neural network opens a new window for future research, showcasing the deep learning-based methods' huge potential for accurate hyperspectral data classification. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Seabed mapping is currently the baseline information for ocean management and conservation, and is an indispensable item within research and Marine Spatial Planning. Here, we use a case study and published data along the southeast Brazilian continental shelf to illustrate the concepts and ideas of potential benthic habitat mapping and the importance of having maps on different scales and the potential for using a multi-design approach. The case analysis presented here uses a regional map and distinct criteria (seabed geodiversity and biodiversity, and potential influence of a tailings plume) to define three areas along the continental shelf to be mapped in a high-resolution, as part of a marine monitoring program. The background of the case study is a tailing dam failure disaster that led to the input of iron ore tailings in the ocean, leading to a major environmental disaster. Three areas were chosen, including: a Marine Protected Area (MPA Costa das Algas), a major fishing ground (the Doce River prodelta/depocenter), and an understudied reef area (Forgotten Reefs). Potential benthic habitat mapping was carried out using acoustic surveys (multibeam echosounder acquiring bathymetry and backscatter) and ground-truthing (sediment samples and seafloor image). Results detailed the potential habitats throughout the three areas, providing primary information for the study of benthic habitats and their distribution. The multi-design approach indicated that although a regional analysis can indicate potential vulnerability as a first assessment approach, high-resolution potential habitat mapping (herein, 20 m or finer) is beneficial to evaluate and produce a higher-confidence level for decision-makers. Having an overall view of what and where to collect new and finer data would be best to identify vulnerable areas that, in this case study, could be threatened by plume dispersion and tailings accumulation. Our results support the delineation of priority areas aiming for monitoring, protection and guiding for other studies, besides the consolidation of habitat importance and the integration of various datasets through a hierarchical classification scheme. Although Brazil has never produced a regional or national habitat map for the entire continental margin, there are already conditions to plan, execute and maintain a habitat mapping program, partnering with Universities, Government Institutions (e.g., the Brazilian Navy), and the private sector. In the context of the UN Decade of Ocean Science targets, it is urgent to plan and implement a national database capable of supporting a habitat classification effort on a broader national scale, with the flexibility to support a multi-design or a multi-scale approach.},

abstract = {Predictions about the ecological consequences of oceanic uptake of CO 2 have been preoccupied with the effects of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, particularly those critical to the formation of habitats (e.g. coral reefs) or their maintenance (e.g. grazing echinoderms). This focus overlooks the direct effects of CO2 on non-calcareous taxa, particularly those that play critical roles in ecosystem shifts. We used two experiments to investigate whether increased CO2 could exacerbate kelp loss by facilitating non-calcareous algae that, we hypothesized, (i) inhibit the recovery of kelp forests on an urbanized coast, and (ii) form more extensive covers and greater biomass under moderate future CO2 and associated temperature increases. Our experimental removal of turfs from a phase-shifted system (i.e. kelp- to turf-dominated) revealed that the number of kelp recruits increased, thereby indicating that turfs can inhibit kelp recruitment. Future CO2 and temperature interacted synergistically to have a positive effect on the abundance of algal turfs, whereby they had twice the biomass and occupied over four times more available space than under current conditions. We suggest that the current preoccupation with the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers overlooks potentially profound effects of increasing CO2 and temperature on non-calcifying organisms. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Convolutional autoencoders have emerged as popular methods for unsupervised defect segmentation on image data. Most commonly, this task is performed by thresholding a per-pixel reconstruction error based on an `p-distance. This procedure, however, leads to large residuals whenever the reconstruction includes slight localization inaccuracies around edges. It also fails to reveal defective regions that have been visually altered when intensity values stay roughly consistent. We show that these problems prevent these approaches from being applied to complex real-world scenarios and that they cannot be easily avoided by employing more elaborate architectures such as variational or feature matching autoencoders. We propose to use a perceptual loss function based on structural similarity that examines inter-dependencies between local image regions, taking into account luminance, contrast, and structural information, instead of simply comparing single pixel values. It achieves significant performance gains on a challenging real-world dataset of nanofibrous materials and a novel dataset of two woven fabrics over state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised defect segmentation that use per-pixel reconstruction error metrics.},

abstract = {Analysis of the seabed composition over a large spatial scale is an interesting yet very challenging task. Apart from the field work involved, hours of video footage captured by cameras mounted on Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) have to be reviewed by an expert in order to classify the seabed topology and to identify potential anthropogenic impacts on sensitive benthic assemblages. Apart from being time consuming, such work is highly subjective and through visual inspection alone, a quantitative analysis is highly unlikely to be made. This study investigates the applicability of various Machine Learning techniques for the automatic classification of the seabed into maerl and sand regions from recorded ROV footage. ROV data collected from depths ranging between 50 m and 140 m and at 9.5 km from the northeast coastline of the Maltese Islands, is processed. Through the application of the presented technique, 5.23 GB of data corresponding to 2 h and 24 min of footage which was collected during June 2013, was initially cleaned and classified. An estimate for the percentage cover of the two benthic habitats (sandy seabed and maerl) was also computed by using artifacts encountered during the ROV survey and of known dimensions as a reference. Unlike other automatic seabed mapping techniques, the presented prototype processes video footage captured by a down-facing camera and not through acoustic backscatter. Image data is easier and much cheaper to capture. Promising results that indicate a very good degree of agreement between the true and predicted habitat type distribution values, were obtained.},

De-glinting in UAV image analysis may improve coral distribution mapping accuracy result compared with an uncorrected image classification technique. The objective of this research was to determine accuracy of coral reef habitat classification maps based on glint correction methods proposed by Lyzenga et al., Joyce, Hedley et al., and Goodman et al. The UAV imagery collected from the coral-dominated Pulau Bidong (Peninsular Malaysia) on 20 April 2016 was analyzed in this study. Images were pre-processed with the following two strategies: Strategy-1 was the glint removal technique applied to the whole image, while Strategy-2 used only the regions impacted by glint instead of the whole image. Accuracy measures for the glint corrected images showed that the method proposed by Lyzenga et al. following Strategy-2 could eliminate glints over the branching coral-Acropora (BC), tabulate coral-Acropora + Montipora (TC), patch coral (PC), coral rubble (R), and sand (S) with greater accuracy than the other four methods using Strategy-1. Tested in two different coral environments (Site-1: Pantai Pasir Cina and Site-2: Pantai Vietnam), the glint-removed UAV imagery produced reliable maps of coral habitat distribution with finer details. The proposed strategies can potentially be used to remove glint from UAV imagery and may improve usability of glint-affected imagery, for analyzing spatiotemporal changes of coral habitats from multi-temporal UAV imagery.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45-60% of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Rinde et al.},

In the process, a remote-sensing reflectance spectrum is modeled by a set of values of absorption, backscattering, bottom albedo, and bottom depth; then it is compared with the spectrum from measurements. The difference between the two spectral curves is minimized by adjusting the model values in a predictor-corrector scheme. No information in addition to the measured reflectance is required. When the difference reaches a minimum, or the set of variables is optimized, absorption coefficients and bottom depths along with other properties are derived simultaneously. For computer-simulated data at a wind speed of 5 m/s the retrieval error was 5.3% for depths ranging from 2.0 to 20.0 m and 7.0% for total absorption coefficients at 440 nm ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 m(-1). At a wind speed of 10 m/s the errors were 5.1% for depth and 6.3% for total absorption at 440 nm. For field data with depths ranging from 0.8 to 25.0 m the difference was 10.9% (R2 = 0.96, N = 37) between inversion-derived and field-measured depth values and just 8.1% (N = 33) for depths greater than 2.0 m. These results suggest that the model and the method used in this study, which do not require in situ calibration measurements, perform very well in retrieving in-water optical properties and bottom depths from above-surface hyperspectral measurements.},

abstract = {Because benthic ecosystems of seamounts support vulnerable biota that are increasingly threatened by mining and fishing, assessments of ecological conditions and impacts are important to balance resource extraction with biological conservation. These assessments rely on ecological metrics generated from physical collections of fauna with sleds or similar gears, or by surveying the seafloor with cameras. If different gears (sled or cameras) “sample” the benthos differently, derived ecological metrics will also differ. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing data provided by a robust benthic sled and a quantitative towed camera from colocated transects on seamounts off Tasmania (Australia). Our comparison showed these tools provide complementary but not interchangeable metrics of seamount benthic diversity and abundance. Choice of sampler(s) needs to be determined by survey objectives and consider the following trade-offs: (1) sleds will detect more species than image-based techniques; (2) specimens obtained by physical sampling (sleds) can considerably extend the scope of ecological analysis through genetic, isotopic, and other analysis of biological material not available from camera surveys; (3) image-derived data provide significantly and often considerably, higher estimates of megabenthos abundance; and (4) environmental impacts are much lower in camera surveys and therefore are arguably more ethical—an important consideration when repeat surveys are required, especially in areas of high conservation importance or heightened sensitivity. Undersampling by sleds of corals and sponges is an important aspect of gear selectivity because these taxa are consistently prominent indicators in protocols that identify benthic “vulnerable marine ecosystems” in assessments of human impacts.},

@article{Hedley2017,
abstract = {The capability for mapping two species of seagrass, Thalassia testudinium and Syringodium filiforme, by remote sensing using a physics based model inversion method was investigated. The model was based on a three-dimensional canopy model combined with a model for the overlying water column. The model included uncertainty propagation based on variation in leaf reflectances, canopy structure, water column properties, and the air-water interface. The uncertainty propagation enabled both a-priori predictive sensitivity analysis of potential capability and the generation of per-pixel error bars when applied to imagery. A primary aim of the work was to compare the sensitivity analysis to results achieved in a practical application using airborne hyperspectral data, to gain insight on the validity of sensitivity analyses in general. Results showed that while the sensitivity analysis predicted a weak but positive discrimination capability for species, in a practical application the relevant spectral differences were extremely small compared to discrepancies in the radiometric alignment of the model with the imagery-even though this alignment was very good. Complex interactions between spectral matching and uncertainty propagation also introduced biases. Ability to discriminate LAI was good, and comparable to previously published methods using different approaches. The main limitation in this respect was spatial alignment with the imagery with in situ data, which was heterogeneous on scales of a few meters. The results provide insight on the limitations of physics based inversion methods and seagrass mapping in general. Complex models can degrade unpredictably when radiometric alignment of the model and imagery is not perfect and incorporating uncertainties can have non-intuitive impacts on method performance. Sensitivity analyses are upper bounds to practical capability, incorporating a term for potential systematic errors in radiometric alignment may be advisable. While T. testudinium and S. filiforme were too spectrally similar to be discriminated purely on spectral grounds, mapping of these, and other species may be achievable by exploiting co-incident factors based on ecological zonation.},

abstract = {Thematic mapping provides today's analysts with an essential geospatial science tool for conveying spatial information. The advancement of remote sensing and computer science technologies has provided classification methods for mapping at both pixel-based and object-based analysis, for increasingly complex environments. These thematic maps then serve as vital resources for a variety of research and management needs. However, to properly use the resulting thematic map as a decision-making support tool, an assessment of map accuracy must be performed. The methods for assessing thematic accuracy have coalesced into a site-specific multivariate analysis of error, measuring uncertainty in relation to an established reality known as reference data. Ensuring statistical validity, access and time constraints, and immense costs limit the collection of reference data in many projects. Therefore, this research proposes evaluating the feasibility of adopting the low-cost, flexible, high-resolution sensor-capable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS, UAV, or Drone) platform for collecting reference data to use in thematic map accuracy assessments for complex environments. This pilot study analyzed 377.57 ha of New England forests, over six University of New Hampshire woodland properties, to compare the similarity between UAS-derived orthomosaic samples and ground-based continuous forest inventory (CFI) plot classifications of deciduous, mixed, and coniferous forest cover types. Using an eBee Plus fixed-wing UAS, 9173 images were acquired and used to create six comprehensive orthomosaics. Agreement between our UAS orthomosaics and ground-based sampling forest compositions reached 71.43% for pixel-based classification and 85.71% for object-based classification reference data methods. Despite several documented sources of uncertainty or error, this research demonstrated that UAS are capable of highly efficient and effective thematic map accuracy assessment reference data collection. As UAS hardware, software, and implementation policies continue to evolve, the potential to meet the challenges of accurate and timely reference data collection will only increase.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral seafloor surveys using airborne or spaceborne sensors are generally limited to shallow coastal areas, due to the requirement for target illumination by sunlight. Deeper marine environments devoid of sunlight cannot be imaged by conventional hyperspectral imagers. Instead, a close-range, sunlight-independent hyperspectral survey approach is required. In this study, we present the first hyperspectral image data from the deep seafloor. The data were acquired in approximately 4200 m water depth using a new Underwater Hyperspectral Imager (UHI) mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). UHI data were recorded for 112 spectral bands between 378 nm and 805 nm, with a high spectral (4 nm) and spatial resolution (1 mm per image pixel). The study area was located in a manganese nodule field in the Peru Basin (SE Pacific), close to the DISCOL (DISturbance and reCOLonization) experimental area. To test whether underwater hyperspectral imaging can be used for detection and mapping of mineral deposits in potential deep-sea mining areas, we compared two supervised classification methods, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The results show that SVM is superior to SAM and is able to accurately detect nodule surfaces. The UHI therefore represents a promising tool for high-resolution seafloor exploration and characterisation prior to resource exploitation.},

abstract = {Precise and spatially-explicit knowledge of leaf chlorophyll content (Chl) is crucial to adequately interpret the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) signal from space. Accompanying information about the reliability of the Chl estimation becomes more important than ever. Recently, a new statistical method was proposed within the family of nonparametric Bayesian statistics, namely Gaussian Processes regression (GPR). GPR is simpler and more robust than their machine learning family members while maintaining very good numerical performance and stability. Other features include: i) GPR requires a relatively small training data set and can adopt very flexible kernels, ii) GPR identifies the relevant bands and observations in establishing relationships with a variable, and finally iii) along with pixelwise estimations GPR provides accompanying confidence intervals. We used GPR to retrieve Chl from hyperspectral reflectance data and evaluated the portability of the regression model to other images. Based on field Chl measurements from the SPARC dataset and corresponding spaceborne CHRIS spectra (acquired in 2003, Barrax, Spain), GPR developed a regression model that was excellently validated (r2: 0.96, RMSE: 3.82 \mu{\rm g/cm}2 ). The SPARC-trained GPR model was subsequently applied to CHRIS images (Barrax, 2003, 2009) and airborne CASI flightlines (Barrax 2009) to generate Chl maps. The accompanying confidence maps provided insight in the robustness of the retrievals. Similar confidences were achieved by both sensors, which is encouraging for upscaling Chl estimates from field to landscape scale. Because of its robustness and ability to deliver confidence intervals, GPR is evaluated as a promising candidate for implementation into ChF processing chains. {\textcopyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Norwegian seaweed industry is expanding and there is a need for accurate estimates of protein content of seaweed species from Norwegian waters. A solid method to calculate protein content is through the sum of the proteomic amino acids; however, it can be expensive and beyond the capacities of many laboratories. The most commonly used method to quantify protein is based on the assessment of crude protein from overall nitrogen content, using the traditional nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor of 6.25. However, this approach can be inaccurate when applied to seaweeds, often resulting in an overestimation of their protein content. Specific nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors, calculated from amino acid composition and total nitrogen, give a more reliable protein quantification in seaweeds. However, no such factors are available for species from Norwegian waters. This study was designed to characterize the amino acid composition of 21 seaweed species from Norwegian waters and use the amino acid data to estimate protein contents of the seaweeds. Crude protein analysis (nitrogen × 6.25) was performed and resulted in overestimation (18–44 %) of the protein content compared to the sum of proteomic amino acids. Specific nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors, calculated for each species, ranged from 3.53 ± 0.1 to 5.13 ± 0.1. This study provides nutritional data on Norwegian seaweeds, covering a relatively wide range of species. Moreover, it is the first study to assess nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors on such species.},

abstract = {In mixed-species forests of complex structure, the delineation of tree crowns is problematic because of their varying dimensions and reflectance characteristics, the existence of several layers of canopy (including understorey), and shadowing within and between crowns. To overcome this problem, an algorithm for delineating tree crowns has been developed using eCognition Expert and hyperspectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-2) data acquired over a forested landscape near Injune, central east Queensland, Australia. The algorithm has six components: 1) the differentiation of forest, non-forest and understorey; 2) initial segmentation of the forest area and allocation of segments (objects) to larger objects associated with forest spectral types (FSTs); 3) initial identification of object maxima as seeds within these larger objects and their expansion to the edges of crowns or clusters of crowns; 4) subsequent classification-based separation of the resulting objects into crown or cluster classes; 5) further iterative splitting of the cluster classes to delineate more crowns; and 6) identification and subsequent merging of oversplit objects into crowns or clusters. In forests with a high density of individuals (e.g., regrowth), objects associated with tree clusters rather than crowns are delineated and local maxima counted to approximate density. With reference to field data, the delineation process provided accuracies > ∼70% (range 48-88%) for individuals or clusters of trees of the same species with diameter at breast height (DBH) exceeding 10 cm (senescent and dead trees excluded), with lower accuracies associated with dense stands containing several canopy layers, as many trees were obscured from the view of the CASI sensor. Although developed using 1-m spatial resolution CASI data acquired over Australian forests, the algorithm has application elsewhere and is currently being considered for integration into the Definiens product portfolio for use by the wider community. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

We present the details of underwater data acquisition, processing and curation to create this large dataset of coral reef imagery annotated for habitat mapping. A diver-operated hyperspectral imaging system (HyperDiver) was used to survey 147 transects at 8 coral reef sites around the Caribbean island of Cura{\c{c}}ao. The underwater proximal sensing approach produced fine-scale images of the seafloor, with more than 2.2 billion points of detailed optical spectra. Of these, more than 10 million data points have been annotated for habitat descriptors or taxonomic identity with a total of 47 class labels up to genus-and species-levels. In addition to HyperDiver survey data, we also include images and annotations from traditional (color photo) quadrat surveys conducted along 23 of the 147 transects, which enables comparative reef description between two types of reef survey methods. This dataset promises benefits for efforts in classification algorithms, hyperspectral image segmentation and automated habitat mapping.},

abstract = {We have developed a simple technique to decorrelate remote sensing color band data from depth in optically shallow water. The method linearizes color band data with respect to depth by subtracting an optically deepwater value from the entire waveband under consideration and taking the natural logarithm of the result. Next, this linearized waveband is rotated about the model 2 regression line computed against a bathymetry band. The rotated color band is decorrelated from water depth. We demonstrate the technique for a small area of Kailua Bay, Oahu, HI, using Quick-bird multispectral and Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey LIDAR data. Results indicate that color band data are effectively decorrelated from depth, while bottom reflector variability is maintained, thus providing the basis for further analysis of the depth-invariant wavebands. The primary benefit of our technique is that wavebands are rotated independently, preserving relative spectral information. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {This literature review summarizes the limiting factors for seagrass occurrence, and the effect positive feedbacks in seagrass systems have on these threshold levels. Minimum water depth is mainly determined by wave orbital velocity, tide and wave energy; and maximum depth by light availability. Besides these, other limiting factors occur, such as an upper current velocity threshold, above which seagrasses are eroded, or a lower water current velocity threshold below which carbon exchange is limiting. In some locations organic matter content, sulphide concentration or nutrient availability are limiting. N-limitation is mainly reported from temperate terrigenous sediments, and P-limitation from tropical carbonate sediments. However, limiting factors sometimes change over the year, switching from light limiting to N- or P-limiting, and show at times regional variation. The effect seagrasses have on current reduction, trapping sediment and decreasing resuspension can lead to several changes in both the sediment and the water column. In the sediment, an increase in nutrient availability has been reported, and increases in organic matter, sediment height increases, and burial of the seagrasses. In the water column the effect is a reduction of the turbidity through a decrease of the sediment load, decreasing the attenuation coefficient, thereby increasing light availability. Due to the large effect light availability has on seagrass occurrence, the effect of an improvement of the light conditions by a reduction of the turbidity by seagrasses is probably the most important positive feedback in seagrass systems. The latter effect should therefore be incorporated in models that try to understand or predict seagrass changes. Generalization are difficult due a lack of studies that try to find relationships between seagrass architecture and sediment trapping (studying both turbidity reduction and nutrient increase) on a global level under a variety of different conditions. Areas for research priorities are identified. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper provides initial validation results for GOCI-derived water products using match-ups between the satellite and ship-borne in situ data for the period of 2010-2011, with a focus on remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). Match-up data were constructed through systematic quality control of both in situ and GOCI data, and a manual inspection of associated GOCI images to identify pixels contaminated by cloud, land and inter-slot radiometric discrepancy. Efforts were made to process and quality check the in situ Rrs data. This selection process yielded 32 optimal match-ups for the Rrs spectra, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl_a) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and with 20 match-ups for suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM). Most of the match-ups are located close to shore and thus the validation should be interpreted limiting to near-shore coastal waters. The Rrs match-ups showed the mean relative errors of 18-33% for the visible bands with the lowest 18-19% for the 490 nm and 555 nm bands and 33% for the 412 nm band. Correlation for the Rrs match-ups was high in the 490-865 nm bands (R2=0. 72-0.84) and lower in the 412 nm band (R2=0.43) and 443 nm band (R2=0.66). The match-ups for Chl_a showed a low correlation (<0.41) although the mean absolute percentage error was 35% for the GOCI standard Chl_a. The CDOM match-ups showed an even worse comparison with R2<0.2. These match-up comparison for Chl_a and CDOM would imply the difficulty to estimate Chl_a and CDOM in near-shore waters where the variability in SPM would dominate the variability in Rrs. Clearly, the match-up statistics for SPM was better with R2=0.73 and 0.87 for two evaluated algorithms, although GOCI-derived SPM overestimated low concentration and underestimated high concentration. Based on this initial match-up analysis, we made several recommendations -1) to collect more offshore under-water measurements of the Rrs data, 2) to include quality flags in level-2 products, 3) to introduce an ISRD correction in the GOCI processing chain, 4) to investigate other types of in-water algorithms such as semianalytical ones, and 5) to investigate vicarious calibration for GOCI data and to maintain accurate and consistent calibration of field radiometric instruments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Korea Ocean Research & Development Institute (KORDI) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Specular reflection of solar radiation on non-flat water surfaces is a serious confounding factor for benthic remote sensing in shallow-water environments. This problem was recently overcome by Hochberg et al., who provided an effective method for the removal of 'sun glint' from remotely sensed images by utilization of the brightness in a near-infrared (NIR) band. Application of the technique was shown to give an increase in the accuracy of benthic habitat classification. However, as presented, the method is sensitive to outlier pixels, requires a time-consuming masking of land and cloud, and is not formulated in a manner leading to ease of implementation. We present a revised version of the method, which is more robust, does not require masking and can be implemented very simply. The practical approach described here will hopefully expedite the routine adoption of this effective and simple technique throughout the aquatic remote sensing community. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract = {Imaging using lightweight, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) is one of the most rapidly developing fields in remote sensing technology. The new, tunable, Fabry-Perot interferometer-based (FPI) spectral camera, which weighs less than 700 g, makes it possible to collect spectrometric image blocks with stereoscopic overlaps using light-weight UAV platforms. This new technology is highly relevant, because it opens up new possibilities for measuring and monitoring the environment, which is becoming increasingly important for many environmental challenges. Our objectives were to investigate the processing and use of this new type of image data in precision agriculture. We developed the entire processing chain from raw images up to georeferenced reflectance images, digital surface models and biomass estimates. The processing integrates photogrammetric and quantitative remote sensing approaches. We carried out an empirical assessment using FPI spectral imagery collected at an agricultural wheat test site in the summer of 2012. Poor weather conditions during the campaign complicated the data processing, but this is one of the challenges that are faced in operational applications. The results indicated that the camera performed consistently and that the data processing was consistent, as well. During the agricultural experiments, promising results were obtained for biomass estimation when the spectral data was used and when an appropriate radiometric correction was applied to the data. Our results showed that the new FPI technology has a great potential in precision agriculture and indicated many possible future research topics. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised feature selection techniques for classification tasks, where only sparse training data are available. This is motivated by the fact that unsupervised feature selection techniques combine the advantages of standard dimensionality reduction techniques (which only rely on the given feature vectors and not on the corresponding labels) and supervised feature selection techniques (which retain a subset of the original set of features). Thus, feature selection becomes independent of the given classification task and, consequently, a subset of generally versatile features is retained. We present different techniques relying on the topology of the given sparse training data. Thereby, the topology is described with an ultrametricity index. For the latter, we take into account the Murtagh Ultrametricity Index (MUI) which is defined on the basis of triangles within the given data and the Topological Ultrametricity Index (TUI) which is defined on the basis of a specific graph structure. In a case study addressing the classification of high-dimensional hyperspectral data based on sparse training data, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed unsupervised feature selection techniques in comparison to standard dimensionality reduction and supervised feature selection techniques on four commonly used benchmark datasets. The achieved classification results reveal that involving supervised feature selection techniques leads to similar classification results as involving unsupervised feature selection techniques, while the latter perform feature selection independently from the given classification task and thus deliver generally versatile features.},

abstract = {The mapping and assessment of the ecosystem services provided by benthic habitats is a highly valuable source of information for understanding their current and potential benefits to society. The main objective of this research is to assess and map the ecosystem services provided by benthic habitats in the European North Atlantic Ocean, in the context of the "Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services" (MAES) programme, the European Biodiversity Strategy and the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In total, 62 habitats have been analyzed in relation to 12 ecosystem services over 1.7 million km2. Results indicated that more than 90% of the mapped area provides biodiversity maintenance and food provision services; meanwhile, grounds providing reproduction and nursery services are limited to half of the mapped area. Benthic habitats generally provide more services closer to shore-rather than offshore-and in shallower waters. This gradient is likely to be explained by difficult access (i.e., distance and depth) and lack of scientific knowledge for most of the services provided by distant benthic habitats. This research has provided a first assessment of the benthic ecosystem services on the Atlantic-European scale, with the provision of ecosystem services maps and their general spatial distribution patterns. Regarding the objectives of this research, conclusions are: (i) benthic habitats provide a diverse set of ecosystem services, being the food provision, with biodiversity maintenance services more extensively represented. In addition, other regulating and cultural services are provided in a more limited area; and (ii) the ecosystem services assessment categories are significantly related to the distance to the coast and to depth (higher near the coast and in shallow waters).},

Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2yr-1since 1980 and that 29% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9% yr-1before 1940 to 7% yr-1since 1990. Seagrass loss rates are comparable to those reported for mangroves, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests and place seagrass meadows among the most threatened ecosystems on earth.},

Our review showed that field-based mapping of seagrass has traditionally been the most common approach in the GBR-WHA, with few attempts to adopt remote sensing approaches and emerging technologies. Using a series of case studies to harness the power of machine-and deep-learning, we mapped seagrass cover with PlanetScope and UAV-captured imagery in a variety of settings. Using a machine-learn-ing pixel-based classification coupled with a bootstrapping process, we were able to significantly improve maps of seagrass, particularly in low cover, fragmented and complex habitats. We also used deep-learning models to derive enhanced maps from UAV imagery. Combined, these lessons and emerging technologies show that more accurate and efficient seagrass mapping approaches are possible, producing maps of higher confidence for users and enabling the upscaling of seagrass mapping into the future.},

Relatively less attention has been given to the effects of the water column on the hyperspectral signal given various water depths and bottom types. Hyperspectral in situ reflectance was measured at both the top and bottom of the water column to examine the effects of the intervening water layer. A radiative transfer model was used to predict the top-of-the-water column reflectance from a large number of close-range measured bottom spectra. The measured and modeled hyperspectral reflectance spectra were examined separately to compare the degree to which different substrate types can be discriminated once the water column is "added" to the spectra. The classification accuracy assessment indicated that the ability to discriminate benthic habitat based on hyperspectral characteristics is limited when the effects of the water column are included as the kappa statistic drops from 0.70 to 0.49. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Seagrass meadows are an integral link between marine and inland ecosystems and are at risk from upstream processes such as runoff and erosion. Despite the prevalence of image-specific approaches, the classification accuracies we achieved show that pixel-based spectral classes may be generalized and applied to a time series of images that were not included in the classifier training. We employed in-situ data on seagrass abundance from 2007 to 2011 to train and validate a classification model. We created depth-invariant bands from TM bands 1, 2, and 3 to correct for variations in water column depth prior to building the classification model. In-situ data showed mean total seagrass cover remained relatively stable over the study area and period, with seagrass cover generally denser in the west than the east. Our approach achieved mapping accuracies (67% and 76% for two validation years) comparable with those attained using spectral libraries, but was simpler to implement. We produced a series of annual maps illustrating inter-annual variability in seagrass occurrence. Accuracies may be improved in future work by better addressing the spatial mismatch between pixel size of remotely sensed data and footprint of field data and by employing atmospheric correction techniques that normalize reflectances across images.},

The seaweed industry today comprises several sectors, such as biopolymers, agriculture/horticulture, cosmetics, thalassotherapy and human consumption, with the former two sectors being of most economic importance. Approximately sixteen seaweed species are commercially utilised, three of which are of particular commercial importance. These are the calcified red algae, referred to as ma{\"{e}}rl, which mainly comprises of two species (Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides) and are exploited by a single company for agricultural, horticultural, food and cosmetic applications. The other bulk species is the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum, which is used for alginate extraction and agriculture/horticulture applications. The latter species sustains an industry, which is an important factor in contributing to the maintenance of coastal communities especially in rural areas of the west coast, particularly in the Gaeltacht of Connemara (Guiry 1997, National Seaweed Forum, 2000). Mechanical harvesting of seaweeds in Ireland is limited to the exploitation of ma{\"{e}}rl. At present, one company has a licence to harvest calcified algae in the south-west of Ireland (Bantry Bay) with 8,000 - 10,000 wet tonnes of ma{\"{e}}rl being extracted from the seabed annually in recent years. The supply of raw material for the Ascophyllum-processing industry as well as for the other industrial sectors relies on harvesters who harvest the seaweed by hand. Although hand-harvesting provides a source of employment in rural areas along the west coast, the age profile is increasing and the numbers of harvesters are declining due to insufficient recruitment of younger harvesters (National Seaweed Forum 2000; Kelly et al. 2001). With growing demands for seaweeds, it is uncertain whether hand-harvesting will provide sufficient raw material in the long-term. The National Seaweed Forum has evaluated the current state of the Irish Seaweed Industry. The forum was launched by the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources in 1999 and consists of 19 members from state agencies, third-level institutions and industry. In the final report (National Seaweed Forum, 2000) it was stated that the natural sustainable seaweed resources in Ireland are under-utilised and the industrial potential, including high-value applications, has not been fully realised. The National Seaweed Forum identified two key areas as being crucial to the development of the Irish seaweed industry: 1) Seaweed aquaculture was assumed to provide the most cost-effective method to meet growing market demand with high-quality seaweed for specific sectors such as human consumption, cosmetics and biotechnology. Additionally, a seaweed aquaculture industry is expected to create attractive and high-skilled jobs, especially in peripheral communities in coastal areas. This is based on the fact that seaweeds of interest to high quality applications are often not bulk species, which are easy to harvest in large amounts. Therefore, with cultivation you strongly increase volume/area, which facilitates harvesting and also standardises quality. Cultivation of a bulk species such as kelp is economically not feasible in Europe. 2) The development and introduction of harvesting machinery suitable for Irish conditions was thought to have a significant impact on the expansion of a viable Irish seaweed industry. As a measure to ensure long-term continuity of raw-material supply of bulk species (e.g. A. nodosum, Laminaria species) the investigation of mechanical harvesting techniques with emphasis on sustainability and environmental impact were prioritised as an R&D area (National Seaweed Forum, 2000). An initial comprehensive study of hand and mechanical harvesting of Ascophyllum nodosum, including an environmental impact assessment, was conducted in the late 1990s (Kelly et al., 2001). In this study, a device similar to the Norwegian Ascophyllum cutter (a flat-bottomed boat fitted with a Vaughan vertical wet-well chopper pump) was used. When hand and mechanical harvesting were compared, there was no significant difference in environmental impact caused by the two methods, but mechanical harvesting was found to be less effective and more expensive than hand harvesting. At present, kelp species in Ireland such as L. digitata, L. saccharina and Alaria esculenta, are harvested by hand but only in small amounts. This means that the natural sustainable resources of kelps of Irish shores are under-utilised. Due to the economic importance of L. digitata and L. hyperborea for alginate extraction and the growing demand for kelp by the phycocolloid and other industries, the introduction of mechanical harvesting is currently being considered for Ireland. Mechanised harvesting enables the harvester to remove large amounts of biomass from an area in a relatively short time. It is therefore essential to develop a suitable management scheme to ensure sustainable exploitation of natural resources and continuous integrity of marine habitats. The objective of the present study is to provide an extensive literature review on kelp research, harvesting and resource management as essential background knowledge for the development of an appropriate management strategy for Ireland. The report addresses the following topics: • Biology of kelps • Biodiversity of kelp forests and ecological significance of kelps • Commercial kelp harvesting in France and Norway (methods, management and environmental impact) • Investigations of kelp in Ireland (Growth rates, biomass, biodiversity of kelp beds, regeneration potential, kelp resources) • Legal framework for seaweed harvesting in Ireland • Conclusions and recommendations},

Seaweeds are widely used as food but are also an important ingredient for the cosmetics industry. They also serve to produce hydrocolloids (alginate, agar and carrageenan), which are used as thickening and gelling agents. This document highlights the rising importance of seaweed farming and shows how an essential Asian food has become popular in North and South America as well as in Europe. The report will be useful to those who wish to know more about the seaweed industry, about the markets for commercial seaweeds and about the various sources and methods of production.

abstract = {Sugar kelp forests (Saccharina latissima) normally dominate the sublittoral rocky sea bed in medium exposed to sheltered areas of the Norwegian coast. In 2002, a large-scale disappearance of sugar kelp was observed, and a survey of more than 600 sites along the coast of southern Norway (58-63°N, 6-11°E) during 2004-2009 recorded a large-scale shift from anticipated sugar kelp forests to communities dominated by filamentous, ephemeral macroalgae. The loss of sugar kelp was most severe in the Skagerrak region, and a comparison with earlier studies supported the observed changes in the community structure and regional differences between the Skagerrak region and the west coast. Filamentous red algae dominated the sublittoral communities at the Skagerrak coast, whereas coarsely branched and filamentous brown algae were most abundant at the west coast sites with low or no abundance of sugar kelp. The cause of this large-scale shift is not clear, but our observations suggest eutrophication (nutrient and particle pollution) and climate change (increase in temperature) as the two main drivers synergistically contributing, alongside other factors, to the demise of S. latissima. If the ephemeral algae community represents an alternative stable state, it will have implications for marine coastal zone production and management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Our article describes a data processing workflow for hyperspectral imaging data to compensate for the water column in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types. We provide a MATLAB script that can be readily used to implement the described workflow. We break down each code segment of this script so that it is more approachable for use and modification by end users and data providers. The workflow initially implements the method for water column compensation described in Lyzenga (1978) and Lyzenga (1981), generating depth invariant indices from spectral band pairs. Given the high dimensionality of hyperspectral imaging data, an overwhelming number of depth invariant indices are generated in the workflow. As such, a correlation based feature selection methodology is applied to remove redundant depth invariant indices. In a post-processing step, a principal component transformation is applied, extracting features that account for a substantial amount of the variance from the non-redundant depth invariant indices while reducing dimensionality. To fully showcase the developed methodology and its potential for extracting bottom type information, we provide an example output of the water column compensation workflow using hyperspectral imaging data collected over the coast of Philpott's Island in Long Sault Parkway provincial park, Ontario, Canada. • Workflow calculates depth invariant indices for hyperspectral imaging data to compensate for the water column in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types. • The applied principal component transformation generates features that account for a substantial amount of the variance from the depth invariant indices while reducing dimensionality. • The output (both depth invariant index image and principal component image) allows for the analysis of bottom type in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows are important environments for the blue carbon budget and are potential early indicators for environmental change. Remote sensing is a viable monitoring tool for spatially extensive meadows but most current approaches are limited by the requirement for in situ calibration data or provide categorical level maps rather than quantitative estimates of direct physiological significance. In this paper we present a method for mapping water depth and the leaf area index (LAI, ratio of leaf area to substrate area) of Thalassia testudinum meadows, based on radiative transfer model inversion using an embedded three-dimensional aquatic canopy model. Variations in reflectance due to leaf length, leaf position, sediment coverage on leaves, water depth and solar zenith angle were included in the model to parameterise uncertainty propagation. The model revealed canopy reflectance as a function of LAI decreases exponentially at all wavelengths up to an LAI around four, beyond which increasing canopy density cannot be determined from reflectance. In addition, sediment coverage on leaves has surprisingly little effect on the reflectance of sparse canopies because shading is also a contributor to darkening. The capability of the method for image based mapping was assessed through sensitivity analyses and by application to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Florida Bay collected by the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), with the uncertainty propagation providing per-pixel confidence intervals on all the estimated parameters. Results were consistent across the sensitivity and image analyses and the agreement with field data was good, given the challenges in validation of submerged pixels at metre scale. Uncertainties were high for LAIs greater than two in water of depth 8 m, but lower for sparse canopies and shallower water. For water depths approaching 10 m the pixel-to-pixel variation arising from processes at the water surface upwards was greater than the uncertainties arising from the canopy or water column. The physics-based model inversion approach is readily adaptable to any sensor configuration and to different seagrass species and canopy morphologies. No site-specific in situ data is required and the uncertainty estimates can provide an objective basis for interpreting apparent changes in the distribution of seagrasses over time and space, as revealed by remote sensing techniques.},

abstract = {Aerial surveys on seagrass (Zostera spp.) indicate a three to fourfold increase in bed area from 1994 to 2006 with up to 100 km2 or 11% of intertidal flats in the Northfrisian Wadden Sea (coastal eastern North Sea), observed at seasonal maximum in August when flying during low tide exposure 300 to 500 m above ground. When viewed from the air, difficulties in distinguishing between seagrass and green algae and a lack of contrast on dark-coloured mudflats are sources of error in areal estimates. Particularly the positioning of beds remote from shores was imprecise. However, the consistency in method over time gives confidence to the inferred positive trend which is opposite to the global pattern. Both, the spatial pattern and a recent decrease in storminess suggest that sediment stability is the key factor for seagrass dynamics in this tidal area. On exposed sand flats, high sediment mobility may be limiting and along the sheltered mainland shore land claim activities with high accretion rates may cause a scarcity of seagrass. The potential area of seagrass beds may be twice as large as the realized maximum in 2006 but eventually the rising sea level will reverse the observed seagrass expansion. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag and AWI 2007.},

abstract = {With current and upcoming imaging spectrometers, automated band analysis techniques are needed to enable efficient identification of most informative bands to facilitate optimized processing of spectral data into estimates of biophysical variables. This paper introduces an automated spectral band analysis tool (BAT) based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for the spectral analysis of vegetation properties. The GPR-BAT procedure sequentially backwards removes the least contributing band in the regression model for a given variable until only one band is kept. GPR-BAT is implemented within the framework of the free ARTMO's MLRA (machine learning regression algorithms) toolbox, which is dedicated to the transforming of optical remote sensing images into biophysical products. GPR-BAT allows (1) to identify the most informative bands in relating spectral data to a biophysical variable, and (2) to find the least number of bands that preserve optimized accurate predictions. To illustrate its utility, two hyperspectral datasets were analyzed for most informative bands: (1) a field hyperspectral dataset (400–1100 nm at 2 nm resolution: 301 bands) with leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and green leaf area index (gLAI) collected for maize and soybean (Nebraska, US); and (2) an airborne HyMap dataset (430–2490 nm: 125 bands) with LAI and canopy water content (CWC) collected for a variety of crops (Barrax, Spain). For each of these biophysical variables, optimized retrieval accuracies can be achieved with just 4 to 9 well-identified bands, and performance was largely improved over using all bands. A PROSAIL global sensitivity analysis was run to interpret the validity of these bands. Cross-validated RCV2 (NRMSECV) accuracies for optimized GPR models were 0.79 (12.9%) for LCC, 0.94 (7.2%) for gLAI, 0.95 (6.5%) for LAI and 0.95 (7.2%) for CWC. This study concludes that a wise band selection of hyperspectral data is strictly required for optimal vegetation properties mapping.},

Satellite and manned aircraft surveys can assist but their use may be limited due to the ground sampling resolution or cloud cover. Straightforward and accurate surveillance methods are needed to quantify rates of grass invasion, offer appropriate vegetation tracking reports, and apply optimal control methods. This paper presents a pipeline process to detect and generate a pixel-wise segmentation of invasive grasses, using buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and spinifex (Triodia sp.) as examples. The process integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also commonly known as drones, high-resolution red, green, blue colour model (RGB) cameras, and a data processing approach based on machine learning algorithms. The methods are illustrated with data acquired in Cape Range National Park, Western Australia (WA), Australia, orthorectified in Agisoft Photoscan Pro, and processed in Python programming language, scikit-learn, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) libraries. In total, 342,626 samples were extracted from the obtained data set and labelled into six classes. Segmentation results provided an individual detection rate of 97% for buffel grass and 96% for spinifex, with a global multiclass pixel-wise detection rate of 97%. Obtained results were robust against illumination changes, object rotation, occlusion, background cluttering, and floral density variation.},

In this paper, a novel approach towards the detection of termite mounds with the use of a UAV, hyperspectral imagery, ML and digital image processing is intended. A new pipeline process is proposed to detect termite mounds automatically and to reduce, consequently, detection times. For the classification stage, several ML classification algorithms' outcomes were studied, selecting support vector machines as the best approach for their role in image classification of pre-existing termite mounds. Various test conditions were applied to the proposed algorithm, obtaining an overall accuracy of 68%. Images with satisfactory mound detection proved that the method is “resolution-dependent”. These mounds were detected regardless of their rotation and position in the aerial image. However, image distortion reduced the number of detected mounds due to the inclusion of a shape analysis method in the object detection phase, and image resolution is still determinant to obtain accurate results. Hyperspectral imagery demonstrated better capabilities to classify a huge set of materials than implementing traditional segmentation methods on RGB images only.},

abstract = {Kelps (Laminariales, Ochrophyta) are ecologically and commercially important habitat-forming brown macroalgae, found in coastal ecosystems worldwide. Their presence in the sublittoral fringe makes monitoring kelp forests problematic and consequently they remain relatively understudied. Remote sensing offers new avenues to monitor difficult-to-access biomes, particularly kelp habitats, but previous monitoring efforts have only been tested on an ad hoc basis and a standardized protocol for monitoring kelp requires development. In view of on-going and emerging threats to kelp, there is a need for monitoring to establish detailed baseline information. Wild harvesting of kelp is increasing, illustrated by growing numbers of seaweed and seaweed-containing products. Simultaneously, climate change is causing sea-surface temperatures to rise and influencing kelp distribution and abundance globally. This study reviews the potential for remote sensing in macroalgal studies, with an emphasis on kelp and provides a conceptual framework to support the development of standardized monitoring protocols. Satellite-born sensors and aerial photography have been effective, but these distant sensors cannot operate effectively in turbid temperate waters, and many image surveys do not account for changing tides. Advances are being made in acoustic monitoring, particularly multibeam sound navigation and ranging (SONAR). With some development, there is great potential for a standardized monitoring protocol for kelp, aiding management and conservation efforts.},

abstract = {This study examines the potential of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission for monitoring the biomass and physiological condition of giant kelp forests on local to global scales. Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem found throughout the globe. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI's spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp biomass and physiological state. We analyze a 28-year time series of giant kelp biomass derived from Landsat satellite imagery in order to identify the dominant temporal modes of variability in giant kelp biomass using the California coast as a model region likely to be relevant to other regions of the globe. Temporal variability in California kelp canopy biomass is compared to the expected availability of cloud-free HyspIRI Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) views for regions of the world that contain giant kelp populations. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the physiological condition of giant kelp canopy are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We compare chlorophyll a to carbon ratios (Chl:C) of kelp fronds collected off the coast of California to laboratory and airborne measurements of hyperspectral reflectance in order to develop metrics of kelp physiological condition.The seasonal cycle dominates giant kelp canopy biomass temporal variability. However, the strength and timing of this cycle varies in both space and time. Our projections of cloud-free HyspIRI coverage indicate that the sensor will be able to capture at least 1 cloud free view each season for nearly all of the global giant kelp habitats, thereby illustrating that HyspIRI will resolve the dominant seasonal cycles in giant kelp biomass. A novel spectral index developed here from field observations explained 76% of the variance in Chl:C and was applied to hyperspectral aircraft observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and biophysiology of giant kelp.},

abstract = {Human activity and natural climate trends constitute a major threat to coral reefs worldwide. Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.},

In this framework, a balanced local discriminant embedding algorithm is proposed for spectral feature extraction from high-dimensional hyperspectral data sets. In the meantime, convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically find spatial-related features at high levels. Then, the fusion feature is extracted by stacking spectral and spatial features together. Finally, the multiple-feature-based classifier is trained for image classification. Experimental results on well-known hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed SSFC method outperforms other commonly used methods for hyperspectral image classification.},

abstract = {Nanoproducts represent a potential growing sector and nanofibrous materials are widely requested in industrial, medical, and environmental applications. Unfortunately, the production processes at the nanoscale are difficult to control and nanoproducts often exhibit localized defects that impair their functional properties. Therefore, defect detection is a particularly important feature in smart-manufacturing systems to raise alerts as soon as defects exceed a given tolerance level and to design production processes that both optimize the physical properties and control the defectiveness of the produced materials. Here, we present a novel solution to detect defects in nanofibrous materials by analyzing scanning electron microscope images. We employ an algorithm that learns, during a training phase, a model yielding sparse representations of the structures that characterize correctly produced nanofiborus materials. Defects are then detected by analyzing each patch of an input image and extracting features that quantitatively assess whether the patch conforms or not to the learned model. The proposed solution has been successfully validated over 45 images acquired from samples produced by a prototype electrospinning machine. The low computational times indicate that the proposed solution can be effectively adopted in a monitoring system for industrial production.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {The fate of photosynthetic carbon in marine ecosystems dominated by different types of primary producers was examined by compiling published reports on herbivory, autotrophic respiration, decomposition, carbon storage, and export rates as fractions of net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems dominated by different types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and coastal phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, coral reef algae, macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves). A large fraction (>40%) of the NPP of marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for microphytobenthos (decomposition, ∼25% of NPP). Herbivory tends to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, >40% of NPP) and macroalgae (33.6±4.9% of NPP) and is somewhat less for higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a substantial proportion (24.3-43.5% on average) of their PP. The fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher plants (∼10-17% of NPP) than for algae (0.4-6% of NPP). On average, ∼90% of the phytoplankton NPP is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these ecosystems representing ∼40% of NPP. Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4% of total ocean NPP, as major contributors of the NPP stored (30% of total ocean carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments. Consideration of burial of NPP from marine angiosperms should lead to estimates of total burial of marine NPP that exceed current estimates by 15-50%.},

@article{Neori2004,
abstract = {Rising global demand for seafood and declining catches have resulted in the volume of mariculture doubling each decade, a growth expected by the FAO to persist in the decades to come. This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore water quality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A 1-ha land-based integrated seabream–shellfish–seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in 1 ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish–vegetable farms and a couple of modern fish–algae–shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modern integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture.},

abstract = {Specular reflections of the sun and the sky at the water surface (sun glint, sky glint) can be of comparable intensity or even much higher as the water leaving radiance, even when observation geometry minimizes the sun glint. A number of approaches have been developed for correcting these glint signals, but none of them is working reliably under all conditions. Challenges are the determination of intensity and wavelength dependency of glint in measurements of high spatial and temporal resolution for which the unknown modulations of the water surface by waves are not sufficiently averaged. In general, the reflected radiance differs spectrally significantly from downwelling irradiance, hence their ratio is not a constant, but has a characteristic spectral signature that is mainly determined by scattering processes in the atmosphere. An analytic model has been developed that describes intensity and wavelength dependency of sun glint and sky glint with few parameters. It is implemented in the publicly available software WASI for forward simulation and inverse modeling of radiance and reflectance measurements. Results from applying the model to field measurements are presented.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

This paper describes the utility of textural and local spatial statistics for the improvement of object-oriented classification for QuickBird imagery. All textural/spatial bands were used as additional bands in the supervised object-oriented classification. The texture analysis is based on two levels: segmented image objects and moving windows across the whole image. In the texture analysis over image objects, the angular second moment textural feature at a 45° angle showed an improved classification performance with regard to buildings, depicting the patterns of buildings better than any other directions. The texture analysis based on moving windows across the whole image was conducted with various window sizes (from 3 × 3 to 13 × 13), and four grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features (homogeneity, contrast, angular second moment, and entropy) were calculated. The contrast feature with the 7 × 7 window size improved classification up to 6%. One type of local spatial statistics, Moran's I feature with the vertical neighbourhood rule, improved the classification accuracy even further, up to 7%. Comparison of results between spectral and spectral+textural/spatial information indicated that textural and spatial information can be used to improve the object-oriented classification of urban areas using very high resolution imagery.},

This method, called Gaussian process (GP) regression, formulates the learning of the regressor within a Bayesian framework, where the regression model is derived by assuming the model variables follow a Gaussian prior distribution encoding the prior knowledge about the output function. One of its interesting properties, which gives it a key advantage over state-of-the-art regression methods, is the possibility to tune the free parameters of the model in an automatic way. Experiments were focused on the problem of estimating chlorophyll concentration in subsurface waters. The achieved results suggest that the GP regression method is very promising from both viewpoints of estimation accuracy and free parameter tuning. Moreover, it handles particularly well the problem of limited availability of training samples, typically encountered in biophysical parameter estimation applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

The aim of the research is to train and test convolutional models for automatic land cover mapping and to assess their usability in increasing land cover mapping accuracy and change detection. To solve these tasks, authors prepared a dataset and trained machine learning models for land cover classification and semantic segmentation from satellite images. The results were analysed on three different land classification levels. BigEarthNet satellite image archive was selected for the research as one of two main datasets. This novel and recent dataset was published in 2019 and includes Sentinel-2 satellite photos from 10 European countries made in 2017 and 2018. As a second dataset the authors composed an original set containing a Sentinel-2 image and a CORINE land cover map of Estonia. The developed classification model shows a high overall F\textsubscript{1} score of 0.749 on multiclass land cover classification with 43 possible image labels. The model also highlights noisy data in the BigEarthNet dataset, where images seem to have incorrect labels. The segmentation models offer a solution for generating automatic land cover mappings based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and show a high IoU score for land cover classes such as forests, inland waters and arable land. The models show a capability of increasing the accuracy of existing land classification maps and in land cover change detection.},

abstract = {The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/usemonitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.},

abstract = {Seagrasses are regarded as indicators and first line of impact for anthropogenic activities affecting the coasts. The underlying mechanisms driving seagrass cover however have been mostly studied on small scales, making it difficult to establish the connection to seagrass dynamics in an impacted seascape. In this study, hyperspectral airborne imagery, trained from field surveys, was used to investigate broadscale seagrass cover and genus distribution along the coast of Adelaide, South Australia. Overall mapping accuracy was high for both seagrass cover (98%, Kappa = 0.93), and genus level classification (85%, Kappa = 0.76). Spectral separability allowed confident genus mapping in waters up to 10 m depth, revealing a 3.5 ratio between the cover of the dominant Posidonia and Amphibolis. The work identified the absence of Amphibolis in areas historically affected by anthropogenic discharges, which occasionally contained Posidonia and might be recovering. The results suggest hyperspectral imagery as a useful tool to investigate the interplay between seagrass cover and genus distribution at large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Seagrasses, marine flowering plants, have a long evolutionary history but are now challenged with rapid environmental changes as a result of coastal human population pressures. Seagrasses provide key ecological services, including organic carbon production and export, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, enhanced biodiversity, and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as "coastal canaries," global biological sentinels of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems, with large-scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors, including sediment and nutrient runoff, physical disturbance, invasive species, disease, commercial fishing practices, aquaculture, overgrazing, algal blooms, and global warming, cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection, monitoring, management, and restoration. However, seagrass science, which has rapidly grown, is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses, which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows.},

abstract = {Synthesizing long-term observations at multiple scales is vital for understanding the environmental drivers of ecosystem dynamics. We assessed the role of several environmental drivers in explaining temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the Santa Barbara Channel between 1984 and 2009. We developed a novel method for estimating the canopy biomass of giant kelp from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, which allowed us to examine the dynamics of giant-kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m2 to 100s of km 2 and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25 yr. Comparisons of changes in canopy biomass with oceanographic and climatic data revealed that winter losses of regional kelp canopy biomass were positively correlated with significant wave height (r2 = 0.50), while spring recoveries were negatively correlated with sea surface temperature (r 2 = 0.30; used as a proxy for nutrient availability). On interannual timescales, regional kelp-canopy biomass lagged the variations in wave heights, sea surface temperatures, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index by 3 yr, indicating that these factors affect cycles of kelp recruitment and mortality. Results from cluster analysis showed that the response of kelp biomass to environmental conditions varied among different subregions of the Santa Barbara Channel. The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed regions were related to wave disturbance, while kelp dynamics in sheltered regions tracked sea surface temperatures more closely. These results depict a high level of regional heterogeneity in the biomass dynamics of this important foundation species. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Monitoring salt marshes with remote sensing is necessary to evaluate their state and restoration. Determining appropriate techniques for this can be overwhelming. Our study provides insight into whether a pixel- or object-based Random Forest classification approach is best for mapping vegetation in north temperate salt marshes. We used input variables from drone images (raw reflectances, vegetation indices, and textural features) acquired in June, July, and August 2021 of a salt marsh restoration and reference site in Aulac, New Brunswick, Canada. We also investigated the importance of input variables and whether using landcover classes representing areas of change was a practical way to evaluate variation in the monthly images. Our results indicated that (1) the classifiers achieved overall validation accuracies of 91.1–95.2%; (2) pixel-based classifiers outperformed object-based classifiers by 1.3–2.0%; (3) input variables extracted from the August images were more important than those extracted from the June and July images; (4) certain raw reflectances, vegetation indices, and textural features were among the most important variables; and (5) classes that changed temporally were mapped with user's and producer's validation accuracies of 86.7–100.0%. Knowledge gained during this study will inform assessments of salt marsh restoration trajectories spanning multiple years.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most important and well-studied coral reefs in the world, the full extent of coral habitat of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not well mapped and there is no current and comprehensive map of the GBR's geomorphic zonation or benthic composition. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the “shallow offshore reefs” of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15 m × 15 m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large ($\sim$2500 km2) reef system, of which 245 km2 was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km2 of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.},

abstract = {Maerl is a type of rhodolith, found in ecologically important beds of high conservation value; a major conservation objective is to establish growth rates. Maerl shows internal banding of controversial periodicity that may contain a high-resolution record of palaeoceanographic-palaeoclimatic data. To investigate growth rates and banding periodicity, we used the vital stain Alizarin Red in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Three maerl species, Phymatolithon calcareum, Lithothamnion corallioides and L. glaciale, were collected from maerl beds in Ireland. Following staining, maerl was grown in three controlled temperature treatments and at two depths in the field (P. calcareum only), with Corallina officinalis as a control for the stain. Alizarin Red was shown to be a suitable marker for growth in European maerl species and for C. officinalis. The average tip growth rate of P. calcareum from Northern Ireland at 10 m depth and under constant laboratory conditions was c. 0.9 mm yr-1, double the rates observed at 5 m depth and in L. corallioides. Our measurements and reexamination of reported data allow us to conclude that the three most abundant maerl species in Europe grow about 1 (0.5-1.5) mm per tip per year under a wide range of field and artificial conditions. Internal banding in temperate European maerl revealed by SEM is a result of regular changes in wall thickness; the approximately monthly periodicity of bands in field-grown specimens is consistent with previous suggestions that they may be lunar. The potential for maerl banding to be a high-resolution record of palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental change could be realized with this vital stain in conjunction with isotopic or microgeochemical analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past few years, much effort has been invested into developing a new blue economy based on harvesting, cultivating and processing marine macroalgae in Norway. Macroalgae have high potential for a wide range of applications, e.g. as source of pharmaceuticals, production of biofuels or as food and feed. However, data on the chemical composition of macroalgae from Norwegian waters are scant. This study was designed to characterize the chemical composition of 21 algal species. Both macro- and micronutrients were analysed. Concentrations of heavy metals and the metalloid arsenic in the algae were also quantified. RESULTS: The results confirm that marine macroalgae contain nutrients which are relevant for both human and animal nutrition, the concentrations whereof are highly dependent on species. Although heavy metals and arsenic were detected in the algae studied, concentrations were mostly below maximum allowed levels set by food and feed legislation in the EU. CONCLUSION: This study provides chemical data on a wide range of algal species covering the three taxonomic groups (brown, red and green algae) and discusses both benefits of and potential limitations to their use for food and feed purposes. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {With almost limitless applications across marine and freshwater environments, the number of people using, and wanting to use, remotely piloted aircraft systems (or drones) is increasing exponentially. However, successfully using drones for data collection and mapping is often preceded by hours of researching drone capabilities and functionality followed by numerous limited-success flights as users tailor their approach to data collection through trial and error. Working over water can be particularly complex and the published research using drones rarely documents the methodology and practical information in sufficient detail to allow others, with little remote pilot experience, to replicate them or to learn from their mistakes. This can be frustrating and expensive, particularly when working in remote locations where the window of access is small. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical guide to drone-based data acquisition considerations. We hope to minimise the amount of trial and error required to obtain high-quality, map-ready data by outlining the principles and practice of data collection using drones, particularly in marine and freshwater environments. Importantly, our recommendations are grounded in remote sensing and photogrammetry theory so that the data collected are appropriate for making measurements and conducting quantitative data analysis.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of coastal marine benthic communities enables to adequately estimate the state of coastal marine environment, provide better evidence for environmental changes and describe processes that are conditioned by anthropogenic forces. Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Fucus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (1) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumbricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A standard algorithm for determining depth in clear water from passive sensors exists; but it requires tuning of five parameters and does not retrieve depths where the bottom has an extremely low albedo. To address these issues, we developed an empirical solution using a ratio of reflectances that has only two tunable parameters and can be applied to low-albedo features. The two algorithms - the standard linear transform and the new ratio transform - were compared through analysis of IKONOS satellite imagery against lidar bathymetry. The coefficients for the ratio algorithm were tuned manually to a few depths from a nautical chart, yet performed as well as the linear algorithm tuned using multiple linear regression against the lidar. Both algorithms compensate for variable bottom type and albedo (sand, pavement, algae, coral) and retrieve bathymetry in water depths of less than 10-15 m. However, the linear transform does not distinguish depths > 15 m and is more subject to variability across the studied atolls. The ratio transform can, in clear water, retrieve depths in > 25 m of water and shows greater stability between different areas. It also performs slightly better in scattering turbidity than the linear transform. The ratio algorithm is somewhat noisier and cannot always adequately resolve fine morphology (structures smaller than 4-5 pixels) in water depths > 15-20 m. In general, the ratio transform is more robust than the linear transform.},

abstract = {Biomass production from macroalgae has been viewed as important mainly because of the need for pollution abatement. Environmental considerations will increasingly determine product and process acceptability and drive the next generation of economic opportunity. Some countries, including Japan, are actively promoting "green" technologies that will be in demand worldwide in the coming decades. Should an international agreement on CO2-reduction be ratified, its effective use for energy production would be of high priority. This report shows that macroalgae have great potential for biomass production and CO2 bioremediation. Macroalgae have high productivity, as great or greater than the most productive land plants, and do not compete with terrestrial crops for farm land. The review focuses on recent data on productivity, photosynthesis, nutrient dynamics, optimization and economics. Biomass from macroalgae promises to provide environmentally and economically feasible alternatives to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the techniques and technologies for growing macroalgae on a large-scale and for converting feedstocks to energy carriers must be more fully developed. {\textcopyright} 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Floating mats of vegetation serve to transfer biomass, nutrients and energy across marine habitats and alter the spectral properties of the sea surface. Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630. nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3. days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8. days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5. days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990. nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35. m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60. m. pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity.},

abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for mapping macroalgal habitats if the algal communities are spectrally resolvable. We compared the performance of three classification approaches to determine the distribution of macroalgae communities in the rocky intertidal zone of Heligoland, Germany, using airborne hyperspectral (AISA eagle ) data. The classification results of two supervised approaches (maximum likelihood classifier and spectral angle mapping) are compared with an approach combining k-Means classification of derivative measures. We identified regions of different slopes between main pigment absorption features of macroalgae and classified the resulting slope bands. The maximum likelihood classifier gained the best results (Cohan's kappa = 0.81), but the new approach turned out as a time-effective possibility to identify the dominating macroalgae species with sufficient accuracy (Cohan's kappa = 0.77), even in the heterogeneous and patchy coverage of the study area. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract = {The invasion of the wild oyster Crassostrea gigas along the western European Atlantic coast has generated changes in the structure and functioning of intertidal ecosystems. Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible-near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large flat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas.},

abstract = {Aim: Coastal marine environments experience a wide range of biotic and abiotic forces that can limit and punctuate the geographical range and abundance of species through time. Determining the relative strengths and nonlinear effects of these processes is vital to understanding the biogeographical structures of species. There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. Location: Near-shore areas from A{\~{n}}o Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico border. Methods: We employed empirical orthogonal functions to elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study region over a 25-year period. Results: Wave disturbance, nitrate availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp canopy biomass, explaining 24.5%, 12.7% and 6.1% of the variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes. Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main conclusions: These large-scale analyses help to reconcile the local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the California coastline and show that these dynamics differ predictably in space and time in accordance with local and regional differences in environmental drivers. By characterizing the nonlinear effects of these drivers, we identified spatio-temporal patterns of processes that cannot be detected by remote sensing.},

One large-scale event has been reported where kelp forests along the Norwegian and Russian coast were grazed by sea urchins during the early 1970s. The barren ground area has persisted since. Different theories to explain the grazing event have been presented. This paper seeks to sort and summarize earlier published papers and national reports and to critically examine the most important theories presented to explain the grazing event. The conclusion is that the reason for the event is unknown and it is too late to find causes 40 years after it took place. However, new data and new geographical analysis tools provide insight into the extent and consequences of this dramatic event, and show re-vegetation of kelp forests in the southernmost area. Emphasis in future studies should be given to understand the reasons for shifts between the two ecosystem states and take advantage of the ongoing shift. Such basic ecological knowledge could provide an important basis for better understanding the system and further, to understand the extent to which other observed large-scale changes (e.g. climatic changes, fish stock reductions) affect kelp forest-sea urchin interaction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows are one of the most important benthic habitats in the Baltic Sea. Nevertheless, spatially continuous mapping data of Zostera marina, the predominant seagrass species in the Baltic Sea, are lacking in the shallow coastal waters. Sentinel-2 turned out to be valuable for mapping coastal benthic habitats in clear waters, whereas knowledge in turbid waters is rare. Here, we transfer a clear water mapping approach to turbid waters to assess how Sentinel-2 can contribute to seagrass mapping in the Western Baltic Sea. Sentinel-2 data were atmospherically corrected using ACOLITE and subsequently corrected for water column effects. To generate a data basis for training and validating random forest classification models, we developed an upscaling approach using video transect data and aerial imagery. We were able to map five coastal benthic habitats: bare sand (25 km²), sand dominated (16 km²), seagrass dominated (7 km²), dense seagrass (25 km²) and mixed substrates with red/ brown algae (3.5 km²) in a study area along the northern German coastline. Validation with independent data pointed out that water column correction does not significantly improve classification results compared to solely atmospherically corrected data (balanced overall accuracies $\sim$0.92). Within optically shallow waters (0–4 m), per class and overall balanced accuracies (>0.82) differed marginally depending on the water depth. Overall balanced accuracy became worse (<0.8) approaching the border to optically deep water ($\sim$ 5 m). The spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10–20 m) allowed delineating detailed spatial patterns of seagrass habitats, which may serve as a basis to retrieve spatially continuous data for ecologically relevant metrics such as patchiness. Thus, Sentinel-2 can contribute unprecedented information for seagrass mapping between 0 and around 5 m water depths in the Western Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of 'grey' literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the marine foundation eelgrass species, Zostera marina, along a gradient from the northern Baltic Sea to the north-east Atlantic. This vast region supports a minimum of 1480km2 eelgrass (maximum >2100km2), which corresponds to more than four times the previously quantified area of eelgrass in Western Europe. Eelgrass meadows in the low salinity Baltic Sea support the highest diversity (4-6 spp.) of angiosperms overall, but eelgrass productivity is low (<2g dw m-2 d-1) and meadows are isolated and genetically impoverished. Higher salinity areas support monospecific meadows, with higher productivity (3-10g dw m-2 d-1) and greater genetic connectivity. The salinity gradient further imposes functional differences in biodiversity and food webs, in particular a decline in number, but increase in biomass of mesograzers in the Baltic. Significant declines in eelgrass depth limits and areal cover are documented, particularly in regions experiencing high human pressure. The failure of eelgrass to re-establish itself in affected areas, despite nutrient reductions and improved water quality, signals complex recovery trajectories and calls for much greater conservation effort to protect existing meadows. The knowledge base for Nordic eelgrass meadows is broad and sufficient to establish monitoring objectives across nine national borders. Nevertheless, ensuring awareness of their vulnerability remains challenging. Given the areal extent of Nordic eelgrass systems and the ecosystem services they provide, it is crucial to further develop incentives for protecting them. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {This review examines the various strategies and methods used to produce benthic habitat maps using acoustic remote sensing techniques, coupled with in situ sampling. The applications of three acoustic survey techniques are examined in detail: single-beam acoustic ground discrimination systems, sidescan sonar systems, and multi-beam echo sounders. Over the past decade we have witnessed the nascence of the field of benthic habitat mapping and, on the evidence of the literature reviewed in this paper, have seen a rapid evolution in the level of sophistication in our ability to image and thus map seafloor habitats. As acoustic survey tools have become ever more complex, new methods have been tested to segment, classify and combine these data with biological ground truth sample data. Although the specific methods used to derive habitat maps vary considerably, the review indicates that studies can generally be categorized into one of three over-arching strategies; 1) Abiotic surrogate mapping; 2) Assemble first, predict later (unsupervised classification); 3) Predict first, assemble later (supervised classification). Whilst there is still no widely accepted agreement on the best way to produce benthic habitat maps, all three strategies provide valuable map resources to support management objectives. Whilst there is still considerable work to be done before we can answer many of the outstanding technological, methodological, ecological and theoretical questions that have been raised here, the review concludes that the advent of spatial ecological studies founded on high-resolution environmental data sets will undoubtedly help us to examine patterns in community and species distributions. This is a vital first step in unraveling ecological complexities and thus providing improved spatial information for management of marine systems. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {The behavior of light at the air/water interface has substantial effects on the quality of vertical, or nadir-looking imagery used to interpret subsurface features for purposes such as marine habitat mapping. Reflection of the direct solar beam into the sensor by waves on the surface of the water creates bright glints, which obscure bottom features of interest. Sun angle, refraction, and reflection of the direct solar beam affect the amount of subsurface illumination and shadowing of bottom features. Simple interpretations of these sea surface effects are made with sufficient accuracy to improve planning for airborne, vertical image capture, particularly aerial photography or video imagery. The time available for image capture over shallow water is typically limited to a short period in the morning. The start time is controlled by subsurface illumination levels, which are determined by sun angle and locally variable factors, such as light attenuation by the water column, rather than surface reflection or subsurface shadowing. The end time is determined by sun glitter effects, which in this case study, are predictable from sun angle, camera field of view, and wind speed with an R2 value of 0.9554. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {We present an interpretation of Inception modules in con-volutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17, 000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

abstract = {Robots that use learned perceptual models in the real world must be able to safely handle cases where they are forced to make decisions in scenarios that are unlike any of their training examples. However, state-of-the-art deep learning methods are known to produce erratic or unsafe predictions when faced with novel inputs. Furthermore, recent ensemble, bootstrap and dropout methods for quantifying neural network uncertainty may not efficiently provide accurate uncertainty estimates when queried with inputs that are very different from their training data. Rather than unconditionally trusting the predictions of a neural network for unpredictable real-world data, we use an autoencoder to recognize when a query is novel, and revert to a safe prior behavior. With this capability, we can deploy an autonomous deep learning system in arbitrary environments, without concern for whether it has received the appropriate training. We demonstrate our method with a vision-guided robot that can leverage its deep neural network to navigate 50% faster than a safe baseline policy in familiar types of environments, while reverting to the prior behavior in novel environments so that it can safely collect additional training data and continually improve.},

@article{Hancke2014,
abstract = {The effects of temperature and light on both oxygen (O 2 ) production and gross photosynthesis were resolved in a benthic microalgal community by combining two‐dimensional (2D) imaging of O 2 and variable chlorophyll a (Chl a ) fluorescence. Images revealed a photosynthetically active community with spatial heterogeneity at the millimeter scale. Irradiance strongly increased pore‐water O 2 concentration, sediment net O 2 production, and gross photosynthesis. The latter was derived from measurements of the electron transfer rate (rETR) in Photosystem II. The onset of light saturation for gross photosynthesis was approximately twofold higher than for net O 2 production, reflecting significant light‐stimulated O 2 consumption at higher light (> 75 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ). Temperature stimulated O 2 consumption more than photosynthesis, turning the community more heterotrophic at elevated temperatures. Thus, the compensation irradiance (i.e., the irradiance at which community O 2 production and consumption balance) increased fivefold (from 6 to 30 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ) with a temperature increase from 10°C to 25°C, corresponding to a temperature coefficient (Q 10 ) of 2.9. Whereas net O 2 production had a temperature optimum at ∼ 20°C, no optimum was observed for gross photosynthesis within the investigated range (10°C to 25°C). The resolved 2D net O 2 production and rETR exhibited a significant exponential relationship, demonstrating predictable correlations between the net community production and gross photosynthesis for a complex microbial community, at different temperatures. The present imaging approach demonstrates a great potential to study consequences of environmental effects on photosynthetic activity and O 2 turnover in complex phototrophic benthic communities.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been well studied at the leaf to patch scales, however, the link to large spatial extent landscape and population dynamics is still unresolved in seagrass ecology. Traditional remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal resolution and consistency to appropriately address this issue. This study uses two high temporal resolution time-series of thematic seagrass cover maps to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrass at both an inter- and intra-annual time scales, one of the first globally to do so at this scale. Previous work by the authors developed an object-based approach to map seagrass cover level distribution from a long term archive of Landsat TM and ETM+ images on the Eastern Banks (≈200 km2), Moreton Bay, Australia. In this work a range of trend and time-series analysis methods are demonstrated for a time-series of 23 annual maps from 1988 to 2010 and a time-series of 16 monthly maps during 2008-2010. Significant new insight was presented regarding the inter- and intra-annual dynamics of seagrass persistence over time, seagrass cover level variability, seagrass cover level trajectory, and change in area of seagrass and cover levels over time. Overall we found that there was no significant decline in total seagrass area on the Eastern Banks, but there was a significant decline in seagrass cover level condition. A case study of two smaller communities within the Eastern Banks that experienced a decline in both overall seagrass area and condition are examined in detail, highlighting possible differences in environmental and process drivers. We demonstrate how trend and time-series analysis enabled seagrass distribution to be appropriately assessed in context of its spatial and temporal history and provides the ability to not only quantify change, but also describe the type of change. We also demonstrate the potential use of time-series analysis products to investigate seagrass growth and decline as well as the processes that drive it. This study demonstrates clear benefits over traditional seagrass mapping and monitoring approaches, and provides a proof of concept for the use of trend and time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products to benefit current endeavours in seagrass ecology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

abstract = {Last advances in sensors, photogrammetry and computer vision have led to high-automation levels of 3D reconstruction processes for generating dense models and multispectral orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. However, these cartographic products are sometimes blurred and degraded due to sun reflection effects which reduce the image contrast and colour fidelity in photogrammetry and the quality of radiometric values in remote sensing applications. This paper proposes an automatic approach for detecting sun reflections problems (hotspot and sun glint) in multispectral images acquired with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), based on a photogrammetric strategy included in a flight planning and control software developed by the authors. In particular, two main consequences are derived from the approach developed: (i) different areas of the images can be excluded since they contain sun reflection problems; (ii) the cartographic products obtained (e.g., digital terrain model, orthoimages) and the agronomical parameters computed (e.g., normalized vegetation index-NVDI) are improved since radiometric defects in pixels are not considered. Finally, an accuracy assessment was performed in order to analyse the error in the detection process, getting errors around 10 pixels for a ground sample distance (GSD) of 5 cm which is perfectly valid for agricultural applications. This error confirms that the precision in the detection of sun reflections can be guaranteed using this approach and the current low-cost UAV technology.},

abstract = {Fish farms produce large amounts of wastes, including dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen. To exploit these nutrients as a resource input, and at the same time reduce the risk for eutrophication of the environment, Gracilaria chilensis on ropes was co-cultivated with a salmon cage farm in southern Chile during two summer month. Gracilaria cultivated at 10 m distance from the cages had up to 40% higher growth rate (specific growth rate; 7% day−1) compared to growth at 150 m and 1 km distance. The algae nutrient content was also higher close to the cages (1.9–2.1 mmol N g−1 dw−1 and 0.28–0.34 mmol P g−1 dw−1) compared to the other stations. Yield of agar per unit biomass varied between 17–23% of dry weight and was lowest close to the farm, but due to higher growth rate, the accumulated agar production was highest close to the fish cages. The degree of epiphytes and bryozoa coverage was overall low. An extrapolation of the results showed that a 1 ha cultivation of the algae, close to the fish cages, had the potential to remove at least 5% of dissolved inorganic nitrogen released from the fish farm and 27% of released dissolved phosphorous. Such a cultivation would give an annual harvest of 34 dry t of Gracilaria, worth 34000 US$. We conclude that both economical and environmental advantages can be achieved by integrating the cultivation of algae with fish farming in open sea systems. However, further studies focusing on full scale cultivation and functions during different seasons are needed.},

abstract = {Intertidal landscapes are highly complex and dynamic habitats that exhibit variability over a range of spatial and temporal scales. The spatial arrangement of structure-forming biogenic features such as seagrasses and bivalves influences ecosystem function and the provision of important ecosystem services, though quantification and monitoring of intertidal landscape structure has been hindered by challenges collecting spatial data in the coastal zone. In this study, an intertidal landscape mosaic of eelgrass (Zostera marina) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) was observed using low-altitude aerial photography from a balloon-mounted digital camera platform. Imagery representing seagrass-bivalve landscape structure was classified and analysed using multiple metrics of landscape composition and configuration at the patch scale and the landscape scale. Patch-scale imagery was compared to a previously collected dataset in order to track temporal changes in seagrass patch metrics over a 26-month period. Seagrass and bivalve patches exhibited distinct spatial patterning at different spatial scales. At the patch scale, the change in seagrass metrics was consistent with patch border expansion at the expense of patch density and integrity. These methods demonstrate a novel approach for collecting high-resolution spatial data that could also be valuable to physical geographers dealing with similar fine-scale landscapes. The application of spatial metrics at multiple spatial scales quantified elements of the configuration and composition of a seagrass-bivalve habitat mosaic and allowed for the tracking of patch metrics through time to depict landscape change. Continued development of landscape metrics within intertidal habitats will increase understanding of the ecological function of these areas with benefits to management and monitoring of ecosystem health.},

abstract = {Little is known about the local to regional scale variability in biomass and productivity of many subtidal ecosystems, as appropriate field surveys are both time and labor intensive. Here, we combined high-resolution satellite imagery with aerial photos and diver sampling to assess changes in giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera canopy cover and biomass along a ∼60 km stretch of coastline in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. Our objectives were to (1) develop new methods for estimating giant kelp canopy cover and biomass using satellite imagery, and (2) assess temporal changes in kelp forest biomass across multiple spatial scales. Results of the satellite kelp cover classification compared very favorably with near-coincident high-resolution aerial camera surveys (r2 = 0.90). Monthly diver observations of biomass for fixed plots at 3 kelp forest sites were strongly correlated with satellite determinations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals (r2 = 0.77). This allowed us to examine variation in giant kelp biomass across multiple spatial scales (pixel, plot, site, and region). The relationship between plot scale (40 m) changes in biomass and remote assessments of site scale (∼1 km) changes varied among sites and depended on the relative location of the plot and the size of the kelp forest at each site. Changes in biomass among sites were well correlated with each other and with the aggregated regional (∼60 km) total. Linking field measurements of giant kelp biomass made on a plot scale with regional estimates made by satellite facilitates an understanding of the regional patterns and drivers of biomass and primary production of giant kelp forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {ESA's upcoming satellites Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) aim to ensure continuity for Landsat 5/7, SPOT-5, SPOT-Vegetation and Envisat MERIS observations by providing superspectral images of high spatial and temporal resolution. S2 and S3 will deliver near real-time operational products with a high accuracy for land monitoring. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods. Machine learning regression algorithms may be powerful candidates for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting.By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain) we have compared the utility of four state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms and four different S2 and S3 band settings to assess three important biophysical parameters: leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The tested Sentinel configurations were: S2-10. m (4 bands), S2-20. m (8 bands), S2-60. m (10 bands) and S3-300. m (19 bands), and the tested methods were: neural networks (NN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR).GPR outperformed the other retrieval methods for the majority of tested configurations and was the only method that reached the 10% precision required by end users in the estimation of Chl. Also, although validated with an RMSE accuracy around 20%, GPR yielded optimal LAI and FVC estimates at highest S2 spatial resolution of 10. m with only four bands. In addition to high accuracy values, GPR also provided confidence intervals of the estimates and insight in relevant bands, which are key advantages over the other methods. Given all this, GPR proved to be a fast and accurate nonlinear retrieval algorithm that can be potentially implemented for operational monitoring applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The classification of hyperspectral data is no exception to the rule, but it has intrinsic specificities that make the application of deep learning less straightforward than with other optical data. This article presents the state of the art of previous machine-learning approaches, reviews the various deeplearning approaches currently proposed for hyperspectral classification, and identifies the problems and difficulties that arise in the implementation of deep neural networks for this task. In particular, the issues of spatial and spectral resolution, data volume, and transfer of models from multimedia images to hyperspectral data are addressed. Additionally, a comparative study of various families of network architectures is provided, and a software toolbox is publicly released to allow experimenting with these methods (https://github.com/nshaud/DeepHyperX). This article is intended for both data scientists with interest in hyperspectral data and remote sensing experts eager to apply deeplearning techniques to their own data set.},

abstract = {Global marine conservation remains fractured by an imbalance in research efforts and policy actions, limiting progression towards sustainability. Rhodolith beds represent a prime example, as they have ecological importance on a global scale, provide a wealth of ecosystem functions and services, including biodiversity provision and potential climate change mitigation, but remain disproportionately understudied, compared to other coastal ecosystems (tropical coral reefs, kelp forests, mangroves, seagrasses). Although rhodolith beds have gained some recognition, as important and sensitive habitats at national/regional levels during the last decade, there is still a notable lack of information and, consequently, specific conservation efforts. We argue that the lack of information about these habitats, and the significant ecosystem services they provide, is hindering the development of effective conservation measures and limiting wider marine conservation success. This is becoming a pressing issue, considering the multiple severe pressures and threats these habitats are exposed to (e.g., pollution, fishing activities, climate change), which may lead to an erosion of their ecological function and ecosystem services. By synthesizing the current knowledge, we provide arguments to highlight the importance and urgency of levelling-up research efforts focused on rhodolith beds, combating rhodolith bed degradation and avoiding the loss of associated biodiversity, thus ensuring the sustainability of future conservation programs.},

abstract = {Empirical models relating secchi depths to maximum depth limits of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) can describe basic differences in depth limits between areas or time periods exhibiting large differences in secchi depth. However, these models cannot predict the precise depth limit at a particular site at any specific time. In this study we aim to improve the ability of regression models to predict maximum depth limits by: (1) assuming that eelgrass depth limits respond to changes in secchi depth with a temporal delay of 1-2 years, (2) including other water-quality variables in addition to secchi depth, and (3) taking into account that factors regulating depth limits may vary between years and between sites. We were not able to improve the models by introducing a systematic delay in the response of depth limits to changes in secchi depths. The reason for this failure is likely to have been the systematic nature of our approach, since some sites responded with a delay, while others did not. The explanatory power of the models increased when additional water-quality variables were added in a multiple regression model. Where secchi depth alone explained 58% of the variations in depth limits, addition of winter [NH 4+] and maximum water depth as independent variables increased the explanatory power to 71%. These models applied to data from one specific year, but when data from several years (1989-1998) were included, only 35% of the variation in depth limits could be explained by the three factors. More detailed analyses showed that the regulation of eelgrass depth limits varied considerably between years and between sites, and the models were further improved by taking this information into account. Our results confirmed previous studies by showing light to be the most important parameter in the regulation of eelgrass depth limits, but also revealed a complexity in the regulation of depth limits not expressed in earlier studies. Limited colonisation potentials may delay the response to improved light conditions, and hypoxia/anoxia and indirect effects of nutrients may prevent eelgrass from attaining the depth limit that light levels would allow. The power to predict depth limits on the basis of secchi depths can therefore be improved by taking site-specific information on eelgrass growth conditions into account. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Developments in the capabilities and affordability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an explosion in their use for a range of ecological and agricultural remote sensing applications. However, the ubiquity of visible light cameras aboard readily available UAVs may be limiting the application of these devices for fine-scale, high taxonomic resolution monitoring. Here we compare the use of RGB and multispectral cameras deployed aboard UAVs for assessing intertidal and shallow subtidal marine macroalgae to a high taxonomic resolution. Our results show that the diverse spectral profiles of marine macroalgae naturally lend themselves to remote sensing and habitat classification. Furthermore, we show that biodiversity assessments, particularly in shallow subtidal habitats, are enhanced using six-band discrete wavelength multispectral sensors (81% accuracy, Cohen's Kappa) compared to three-band broad channel RGB sensors (79% accuracy, Cohen's Kappa) for 10 habitat classes. Combining broad band RGB signals and narrow band multispectral sensing further improved the accuracy of classification with a combined accuracy of 90% (Cohen's Kappa). Despite notable improvements in accuracy with multispectral imaging, RGB sensors were highly capable of broad habitat classification and rivaled multispectral sensors for classifying intertidal habitats. High spatial scale monitoring of turbid exposed rocky reefs presents a unique set of challenges, but the limitations of more traditional methods can be overcome by targeting ideal conditions with UAVs.},

abstract = {Kelp forests are structurally complex habitats, which provide valuable services along 25% of the world's coastlines. Globally, many kelp forests have disappeared and been replaced by turf algae over the last decade. Evidence that environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for kelps, combined with a lack of observed recovery, raises concern that these changes represent persistent regime shifts. Here, we show that human activities mediate turf transitions through geographically disparate abiotic (warming and eutrophication) and biotic (herbivory and epiphytism) drivers of kelp loss. Evidence suggests kelp forests are pushed beyond tipping points where new, stabilizing feedback systems (sedimentation, competition, and Allee effects) reinforce turf dominance. Although these new locks on the degraded ecosystems are strong, a mechanistic understanding of feedback systems and interactions between global and local drivers of kelp loss will expose which processes are easier to control. This should provide management solutions to curb the pervasive trend of the flattening of kelp forests globally.},

abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral remote sensing, is based on the characterization of Earth surface materials and processes through spectrally-resolved measurements of the light interacting with matter. The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However, most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers, as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of EnMAP consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400:1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180:1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. EnMAP images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. EnMAP will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.},

abstract = {Detection of objects embedded in tissue, using visible light, is difficult due to light scattering. The optical properties of the surrounding tissue will influence the spectral characteristics of the light interacting with the object, and the spectral signature observed from the object will be directly affected. A method for calibrating the spectral signature of small objects, embedded in translucent material, by the estimated local background spectrum is presented. The method is evaluated under industrial conditions in a new hyperspectral imaging system for automatic detection of nematodes in cod fillets. The system operates at a conveyor belt speed of 400mm/s which meets the industrial required speed of assessing one fillet per second. The local calibration method reduces the number of spectra needed to be classified by 89.6%. For one or more false alarms in 60% of the fillets sampled after the trimming station, the Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier detects 70.8% and 60.3% of the dark and pale nematodes, respectively. This is better than what is previously reported using a higher resolution instrument on a slow moving conveyor belt, and comparable or better to what is reported for manual inspection under industrial conditions.},

In fact, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry coupled with imagery acquired by UAVs offers a rapid and inexpensive tool to produce high-resolution orthomosaics, giving ecologists a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of ecological processes. Here, we adopted a lightweight quadcopter as an aerial survey tool and object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow to demonstrate the strength of such methods in producing very high spatial resolution maps of sensitive marine habitats. Therefore, three different coastal environments were mapped using the autonomous flight capability of a lightweight UAV equipped with a fully stabilized consumer-grade RGB digital camera. In particular we investigated a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow, a rocky coast with nurseries for juvenile fish, and two sandy areas showing biogenic reefs of Sabelleria alveolata. We adopted, for the first time, UAV-based raster thematic maps of these key coastal habitats, produced after OBIA classification, as a new method for fine-scale, low-cost, and time saving characterization of sensitive marine environments which may lead to a more effective and efficient monitoring and management of natural resources.},

abstract = {Traditional quality control of cod fillets is currently made by manual inspection on candling tables. This is a time consuming and expensive operation, contributing to a significant share of the cost with cod fillet production. In this study, transillumination hyperspectral imaging was implemented as a method for automatic nematode detection in cod fillets moving on a conveyer belt, and evaluated on industrially processed cod fillets. An overall detection rate of 58% of all nematodes (N= 922), with detection rate of 71% and 46% for dark and pale nematodes, respectively, is reported. This is comparable, or better, than what is reported for manual inspection under industrial conditions. The false alarm rate was high, with 60% of the fillets reported with one or more false alarms. These results show that the method is promising, but needs further refinements to reduce the false alarm rate and increase the imaging speed from 25 to 400 mm/s. Practical Application: Manual inspection of cod fillets is a huge bottleneck for the industry, accounting for half the production cost with cod fillet processing and reducing the processing speed. Transillumination hyperspectral imaging has the potential to reduce the manual labor required for cod fillet inspection and hence reduce the cost and increase the end product quality.},
