abstract = {Detection of objects embedded in tissue, using visible light, is difficult due to light scattering. The optical properties of the surrounding tissue will influence the spectral characteristics of the light interacting with the object, and the spectral signature observed from the object will be directly affected. A method for calibrating the spectral signature of small objects, embedded in translucent material, by the estimated local background spectrum is presented. The method is evaluated under industrial conditions in a new hyperspectral imaging system for automatic detection of nematodes in cod fillets. The system operates at a conveyor belt speed of 400mm/s which meets the industrial required speed of assessing one fillet per second. The local calibration method reduces the number of spectra needed to be classified by 89.6%. For one or more false alarms in 60% of the fillets sampled after the trimming station, the Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier detects 70.8% and 60.3% of the dark and pale nematodes, respectively. This is better than what is previously reported using a higher resolution instrument on a slow moving conveyor belt, and comparable or better to what is reported for manual inspection under industrial conditions.},

@article{Audicana2008,
abstract = {Infection of humans with the nematode worm parasite Anisakis simplex was first described in the 1960s in association with the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. During the 1990s it was realized that even the ingestion of dead worms in food fish can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, that these may be more prevalent than infection itself, and that this outcome could be associated with food preparations previously considered safe. Not only may allergic symptoms arise from infection by the parasites ("gastroallergic anisakiasis"), but true anaphylactic reactions can also occur following exposure to allergens from dead worms by food-borne, airborne, or skin contact routes. This review discusses A. simplex pathogenesis in humans, covering immune hypersensitivity reactions both in the context of a living infection and in terms of exposure to its allergens by other routes. Over the last 20 years, several studies have concentrated on A. simplex antigen characterization and innate as well as adaptive immune response to this parasite. Molecular characterization of Anisakis allergens and isolation of their encoding cDNAs is now an active field of research that should provide improved diagnostic tools in addition to tools with which to enhance our understanding of pathogenesis and controversial aspects of A. simplex allergy. We also discuss the potential relevance of parasite products such as allergens, proteinases, and proteinase inhibitors and the activation of basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells in the induction of A. simplex-related immune hypersensitivity states induced by exposure to the parasite, dead or alive.},

@article{Heia2007a,
abstract = {A promising method for detection of parasites in whitefish fillets has been developed. By use of imaging spectroscopy it is possible to record both spectral and spatial information from an object. In this work it is shown that by applying a white light transmission setup and imaging spectroscopy to cod (Gadus morhua) fillets, it is possible to make spectral images containing information to differentiate between fish muscle and parasites. The spectral images are analyzed by discriminant partial least square regression as well as image-filtering techniques. The method identifies parasites on the surface of the fillets as well as embedded parasites. One parasite was detected at 0.8 cm below the fillet surface, which is 2 to 3 mm deeper than what can be found by manual inspection of fish fillets. The method is nonintrusive and should thus be feasible for industrial purposes.},

@article{Sivertsen2011a,
abstract = {Traditional quality control of cod fillets is currently made by manual inspection on candling tables. This is a time consuming and expensive operation, contributing to a significant share of the cost with cod fillet production. In this study, transillumination hyperspectral imaging was implemented as a method for automatic nematode detection in cod fillets moving on a conveyer belt, and evaluated on industrially processed cod fillets. An overall detection rate of 58% of all nematodes (N= 922), with detection rate of 71% and 46% for dark and pale nematodes, respectively, is reported. This is comparable, or better, than what is reported for manual inspection under industrial conditions. The false alarm rate was high, with 60% of the fillets reported with one or more false alarms. These results show that the method is promising, but needs further refinements to reduce the false alarm rate and increase the imaging speed from 25 to 400 mm/s. Practical Application: Manual inspection of cod fillets is a huge bottleneck for the industry, accounting for half the production cost with cod fillet processing and reducing the processing speed. Transillumination hyperspectral imaging has the potential to reduce the manual labor required for cod fillet inspection and hence reduce the cost and increase the end product quality.},
