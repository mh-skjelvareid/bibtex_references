abstract = {This article compares four new automatic methods to discriminate between spruce, pine and birch, which are the dominating tree species in Norwegian forests. Airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data were used. The laser scanning data was used to mask pixels with low or no vegetation in the hyperspectral data. A greenâ€“blue ratio was used to remove shadow areas from tree canopies, and the normalized difference vegetation index to remove dead vegetation and non-vegetation. The best method was hyperspectral pixel classification with 160 spectral channels in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, using a deep neural network. This method achieved 87% correct classification rate. Partial least squares regression for hyperspectral pixel classification achieved 78%. Deep neural network image classification using canopy height blended with three hyperspectral channels achieved 74%. A simple pixel classification method based on two spectral indices resulted in 67% correct classification. A possible future improvement is to find a better way to combine hyperspectral data with canopy height data in a deep neural network.},

@article{Ratkowsky1982,
abstract = {The Arrhenius Law, which was originally proposed to describe the temperature dependence of the specific reaction rate constant in chemical reactions, does not adequately describe the effect of temperature on bacterial growth. Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between in square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, square root = b (T - T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds.
