abstract = {Analysis of the seabed composition over a large spatial scale is an interesting yet very challenging task. Apart from the field work involved, hours of video footage captured by cameras mounted on Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) have to be reviewed by an expert in order to classify the seabed topology and to identify potential anthropogenic impacts on sensitive benthic assemblages. Apart from being time consuming, such work is highly subjective and through visual inspection alone, a quantitative analysis is highly unlikely to be made. This study investigates the applicability of various Machine Learning techniques for the automatic classification of the seabed into maerl and sand regions from recorded ROV footage. ROV data collected from depths ranging between 50 m and 140 m and at 9.5 km from the northeast coastline of the Maltese Islands, is processed. Through the application of the presented technique, 5.23 GB of data corresponding to 2 h and 24 min of footage which was collected during June 2013, was initially cleaned and classified. An estimate for the percentage cover of the two benthic habitats (sandy seabed and maerl) was also computed by using artifacts encountered during the ROV survey and of known dimensions as a reference. Unlike other automatic seabed mapping techniques, the presented prototype processes video footage captured by a down-facing camera and not through acoustic backscatter. Image data is easier and much cheaper to capture. Promising results that indicate a very good degree of agreement between the true and predicted habitat type distribution values, were obtained.},

abstract = {Maerl is a type of rhodolith, found in ecologically important beds of high conservation value; a major conservation objective is to establish growth rates. Maerl shows internal banding of controversial periodicity that may contain a high-resolution record of palaeoceanographic-palaeoclimatic data. To investigate growth rates and banding periodicity, we used the vital stain Alizarin Red in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Three maerl species, Phymatolithon calcareum, Lithothamnion corallioides and L. glaciale, were collected from maerl beds in Ireland. Following staining, maerl was grown in three controlled temperature treatments and at two depths in the field (P. calcareum only), with Corallina officinalis as a control for the stain. Alizarin Red was shown to be a suitable marker for growth in European maerl species and for C. officinalis. The average tip growth rate of P. calcareum from Northern Ireland at 10 m depth and under constant laboratory conditions was c. 0.9 mm yr-1, double the rates observed at 5 m depth and in L. corallioides. Our measurements and reexamination of reported data allow us to conclude that the three most abundant maerl species in Europe grow about 1 (0.5-1.5) mm per tip per year under a wide range of field and artificial conditions. Internal banding in temperate European maerl revealed by SEM is a result of regular changes in wall thickness; the approximately monthly periodicity of bands in field-grown specimens is consistent with previous suggestions that they may be lunar. The potential for maerl banding to be a high-resolution record of palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental change could be realized with this vital stain in conjunction with isotopic or microgeochemical analyses.},

abstract = {Global marine conservation remains fractured by an imbalance in research efforts and policy actions, limiting progression towards sustainability. Rhodolith beds represent a prime example, as they have ecological importance on a global scale, provide a wealth of ecosystem functions and services, including biodiversity provision and potential climate change mitigation, but remain disproportionately understudied, compared to other coastal ecosystems (tropical coral reefs, kelp forests, mangroves, seagrasses). Although rhodolith beds have gained some recognition, as important and sensitive habitats at national/regional levels during the last decade, there is still a notable lack of information and, consequently, specific conservation efforts. We argue that the lack of information about these habitats, and the significant ecosystem services they provide, is hindering the development of effective conservation measures and limiting wider marine conservation success. This is becoming a pressing issue, considering the multiple severe pressures and threats these habitats are exposed to (e.g., pollution, fishing activities, climate change), which may lead to an erosion of their ecological function and ecosystem services. By synthesizing the current knowledge, we provide arguments to highlight the importance and urgency of levelling-up research efforts focused on rhodolith beds, combating rhodolith bed degradation and avoiding the loss of associated biodiversity, thus ensuring the sustainability of future conservation programs.},
