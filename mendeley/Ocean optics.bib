abstract = {Above-surface radiance observations of water need to be corrected for reflections on the surface to derive reflectance. The three-component glint model (3C) [ Opt. Express 25 , A742 ( 2017 ) OPEXFF 1094-4087 10.1364/OE.25.0000A1 ] was developed to spectrally resolve contributions of sky and sun glint to the surface-reflected radiance signal L r ( $\lambda$ ) , and for observations recorded at high wind speed and with fixed-position measurement geometries that frequently lead to significant sun glint contributions. Performance and limitations of 3C are assessed for all relevant wind speeds, clear sky atmospheric conditions, illumination/viewing geometries, and sun glint contamination levels. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of L r ( $\lambda$ ) spectra was simulated with a spectrally resolved sky radiance distribution model and Cox–Munk wave slope statistics. Reflectances were also derived from an extensive four-year data set of continuous above-surface hyperspectral observations from the Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory, allowing to corroborate 3C processing results from simulations and measurements with regard to sky and sun glint contributions. Simulation- and measurement-derived L r ( $\lambda$ ) independently indicate that spectral dependencies of the sky light distribution and sun glint contributions may not be neglected for observations recorded at wind speeds exceeding 4 m / s , even for sun glint-minimizing measurement geometries (Sun-sensor azimuth angle $\Delta$ ϕ = 90 − 135 ° ). These findings are in accordance with current measurement protocols for satellite calibration/validation activities. In addition, it is demonstrated that 3C is able to reliably derive water reflectance for wind speeds up to 8 m/s and $\Delta$ ϕ > 20 ° .},

abstract = {The complexity and heterogeneity of shallow coastal waters over small spatial scales provides a challenging environment for mapping and monitoring benthic habitats using remote sensing imagery. Additionally, changes in coral reef community structure are occurring on unprecedented temporal scales that require large-scale synoptic coverage and monitoring of coral reefs. A variety of sensors and analyses have been employed for monitoring coral reefs: this study applied a spectrum-matching and look-up-table methodology to the analysis of hyperspectral imagery of a shallow coral reef in the Bahamas. In unconstrained retrievals the retrieved bathymetry was on average within 5% of that measured acoustically, and 92% of pixels had retrieved depths within 25% of the acoustic depth. Retrieved absorption coefficients had less than 20% errors observed at blue wavelengths. The reef scale benthic classification derived by analysis of the imagery was consistent with the percent cover of specific coral reef habitat classes obtained by conventional line transects over the reef, and the inversions were robust as the results were similar when the benthic classification retrieval was constrained by measurements of bathymetry or water column optical properties. These results support the use of calibrated hyperspectral imagery for the rapid determination of bathymetry, water optical properties, and the classification of important habitat classes common to coral reefs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Science, resource management, and defense need algorithms capable of using airborne or satellite imagery to accu- rately map bathymetry, water quality, and substrate composition in optically shallow waters. Although a variety of inver- sion algorithms are available, there has been limited assessment of performance and no work has been published com- paring their accuracy and efficiency. This paper compares the absolute and relative accuracies and computational effi- ciencies of one empirical and five radiative-transfer-based published approaches applied to coastal sites at Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas and Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. These sites have published airborne hyperspectral data and field data. The assessment showed that (1) radiative-transfer–based methods were more accurate than the empirical approach for bathymetric retrieval, and the accuracies and processing times were inversely related to the complexity of the models used; (2) all inversion methods provided moderately accurate retrievals of bathymetry, water column inherent optical properties, and benthic reflectance in waters less than 13 m deep with homogeneous to heterogeneous benthic/substrate covers; (3) slightly higher accuracy retrievals were obtained from locally parameterized methods; and (4) no method compared here can be considered optimal for all situations. The results provide a guide to the conditions where each approach may be used (available image and field data and processing capability). A re-analysis of these same or additional sites with satellite hyperspectral data with lower spatial and radiometric resolution, but higher temporal resolution would be instructive to establish guidelines for repeatable regional to global scale shallow water mapping approaches.},

The methodology is based on a physical model for the shallow-water reflectance, and is capable of correcting for at least some range of water-quality and bottom-reflectance variations. Corrections for sun-glint effects are applied prior to the application of the bathymetry algorithm. The accuracy of the depth algorithm is determined by comparison with ground-truth measurements, and comparisons between the observed and calculated radiances are presented for one case to illustrate how the algorithm corrects for water-attenuation and/or bottom-reflectance variations. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is widely used in coastal management. Lyzenga's model has been traditionally used to explain the relationship between bottom surface reflectance and the radiance level measured by satellite. Due to its central assumption, this model lacks accuracy compared with the other radiative transfer models. Nonetheless, it enables, with a single and simple equation, representation of the multiple optical processes taking place in coastal areas. Mapping processes associated with this model may include radiometric correction, a technique previously pointed out as a major driver of mapping accuracy. Radiometric correction is generally based on a depth-invariant index, efficient for clear waters (Jerlov water type I to II) but largely unsuitable when transparency decreases (Jerlov water type II to III). In order to overcome this problem, we developed a new index for radiometric correction, which combines bathymetry data with attenuation coefficients. The improved efficiency of our model with regard to the traditional depth invariant index was demonstrated through two case studies: Funakoshi Bay (Japan; Jerlov water type II) and the Gabes Gulf part located off Mahares (Tunisia; Jerlov water type II to III). {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {An atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed for the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) imagery over optically shallow waters in Sugarloaf Key of the Florida Keys. The AISA data were collected repeatedly during several days in May 2012, October 2012, and May 2013. Non-zero near-infrared (NIR) remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) was accounted for through iterations, based on the relationship of field-measured Rrs between the NIR and red wavelengths. Validation showed mean ratios of 0.94–1.002 between AISA-retrieved and in situ Rrs in the blue to red wavelengths, with uncertainties generally <0.003 sr–1. Such an approach led to observations of short-term changes in AISA-retrieved Rrs from repeated measurements over waters with bottom types of seagrass meadow, sand, and patch reef. Some of these changes are larger than twofold the Rrs uncertainties from AISA retrievals, therefore representing statistically significant changes that can be well observed from airborne measurements. Through radiative transfer modelling, we demonstrated that short-term Rrs changes within 1 hour resulted primarily from sediment resuspension, while tides played a relatively minor role due to the small variation in tidal heights. A sensitivity analysis indicated that although Rrs generally increases with decreasing tide height but increasing suspended sediments, more changes were observed over sandy bottom than over seagrass. The case study suggests that repeated airborne measurements may be used to study short-term changes in shallow-water environments, and such a capacity may be enhanced with future geostationary satellite missions specifically designed to observe coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {We have developed a simple technique to decorrelate remote sensing color band data from depth in optically shallow water. The method linearizes color band data with respect to depth by subtracting an optically deepwater value from the entire waveband under consideration and taking the natural logarithm of the result. Next, this linearized waveband is rotated about the model 2 regression line computed against a bathymetry band. The rotated color band is decorrelated from water depth. We demonstrate the technique for a small area of Kailua Bay, Oahu, HI, using Quick-bird multispectral and Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey LIDAR data. Results indicate that color band data are effectively decorrelated from depth, while bottom reflector variability is maintained, thus providing the basis for further analysis of the depth-invariant wavebands. The primary benefit of our technique is that wavebands are rotated independently, preserving relative spectral information. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper provides initial validation results for GOCI-derived water products using match-ups between the satellite and ship-borne in situ data for the period of 2010-2011, with a focus on remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). Match-up data were constructed through systematic quality control of both in situ and GOCI data, and a manual inspection of associated GOCI images to identify pixels contaminated by cloud, land and inter-slot radiometric discrepancy. Efforts were made to process and quality check the in situ Rrs data. This selection process yielded 32 optimal match-ups for the Rrs spectra, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl_a) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and with 20 match-ups for suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM). Most of the match-ups are located close to shore and thus the validation should be interpreted limiting to near-shore coastal waters. The Rrs match-ups showed the mean relative errors of 18-33% for the visible bands with the lowest 18-19% for the 490 nm and 555 nm bands and 33% for the 412 nm band. Correlation for the Rrs match-ups was high in the 490-865 nm bands (R2=0. 72-0.84) and lower in the 412 nm band (R2=0.43) and 443 nm band (R2=0.66). The match-ups for Chl_a showed a low correlation (<0.41) although the mean absolute percentage error was 35% for the GOCI standard Chl_a. The CDOM match-ups showed an even worse comparison with R2<0.2. These match-up comparison for Chl_a and CDOM would imply the difficulty to estimate Chl_a and CDOM in near-shore waters where the variability in SPM would dominate the variability in Rrs. Clearly, the match-up statistics for SPM was better with R2=0.73 and 0.87 for two evaluated algorithms, although GOCI-derived SPM overestimated low concentration and underestimated high concentration. Based on this initial match-up analysis, we made several recommendations -1) to collect more offshore under-water measurements of the Rrs data, 2) to include quality flags in level-2 products, 3) to introduce an ISRD correction in the GOCI processing chain, 4) to investigate other types of in-water algorithms such as semianalytical ones, and 5) to investigate vicarious calibration for GOCI data and to maintain accurate and consistent calibration of field radiometric instruments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Korea Ocean Research & Development Institute (KORDI) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Specular reflection of solar radiation on non-flat water surfaces is a serious confounding factor for benthic remote sensing in shallow-water environments. This problem was recently overcome by Hochberg et al., who provided an effective method for the removal of 'sun glint' from remotely sensed images by utilization of the brightness in a near-infrared (NIR) band. Application of the technique was shown to give an increase in the accuracy of benthic habitat classification. However, as presented, the method is sensitive to outlier pixels, requires a time-consuming masking of land and cloud, and is not formulated in a manner leading to ease of implementation. We present a revised version of the method, which is more robust, does not require masking and can be implemented very simply. The practical approach described here will hopefully expedite the routine adoption of this effective and simple technique throughout the aquatic remote sensing community. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

Relatively less attention has been given to the effects of the water column on the hyperspectral signal given various water depths and bottom types. Hyperspectral in situ reflectance was measured at both the top and bottom of the water column to examine the effects of the intervening water layer. A radiative transfer model was used to predict the top-of-the-water column reflectance from a large number of close-range measured bottom spectra. The measured and modeled hyperspectral reflectance spectra were examined separately to compare the degree to which different substrate types can be discriminated once the water column is "added" to the spectra. The classification accuracy assessment indicated that the ability to discriminate benthic habitat based on hyperspectral characteristics is limited when the effects of the water column are included as the kappa statistic drops from 0.70 to 0.49. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Our article describes a data processing workflow for hyperspectral imaging data to compensate for the water column in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types. We provide a MATLAB script that can be readily used to implement the described workflow. We break down each code segment of this script so that it is more approachable for use and modification by end users and data providers. The workflow initially implements the method for water column compensation described in Lyzenga (1978) and Lyzenga (1981), generating depth invariant indices from spectral band pairs. Given the high dimensionality of hyperspectral imaging data, an overwhelming number of depth invariant indices are generated in the workflow. As such, a correlation based feature selection methodology is applied to remove redundant depth invariant indices. In a post-processing step, a principal component transformation is applied, extracting features that account for a substantial amount of the variance from the non-redundant depth invariant indices while reducing dimensionality. To fully showcase the developed methodology and its potential for extracting bottom type information, we provide an example output of the water column compensation workflow using hyperspectral imaging data collected over the coast of Philpott's Island in Long Sault Parkway provincial park, Ontario, Canada. • Workflow calculates depth invariant indices for hyperspectral imaging data to compensate for the water column in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types. • The applied principal component transformation generates features that account for a substantial amount of the variance from the depth invariant indices while reducing dimensionality. • The output (both depth invariant index image and principal component image) allows for the analysis of bottom type in shallow, clear to moderate optical water types.},

abstract = {Human activity and natural climate trends constitute a major threat to coral reefs worldwide. Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.},

abstract = {Specular reflections of the sun and the sky at the water surface (sun glint, sky glint) can be of comparable intensity or even much higher as the water leaving radiance, even when observation geometry minimizes the sun glint. A number of approaches have been developed for correcting these glint signals, but none of them is working reliably under all conditions. Challenges are the determination of intensity and wavelength dependency of glint in measurements of high spatial and temporal resolution for which the unknown modulations of the water surface by waves are not sufficiently averaged. In general, the reflected radiance differs spectrally significantly from downwelling irradiance, hence their ratio is not a constant, but has a characteristic spectral signature that is mainly determined by scattering processes in the atmosphere. An analytic model has been developed that describes intensity and wavelength dependency of sun glint and sky glint with few parameters. It is implemented in the publicly available software WASI for forward simulation and inverse modeling of radiance and reflectance measurements. Results from applying the model to field measurements are presented.},

abstract = {The behavior of light at the air/water interface has substantial effects on the quality of vertical, or nadir-looking imagery used to interpret subsurface features for purposes such as marine habitat mapping. Reflection of the direct solar beam into the sensor by waves on the surface of the water creates bright glints, which obscure bottom features of interest. Sun angle, refraction, and reflection of the direct solar beam affect the amount of subsurface illumination and shadowing of bottom features. Simple interpretations of these sea surface effects are made with sufficient accuracy to improve planning for airborne, vertical image capture, particularly aerial photography or video imagery. The time available for image capture over shallow water is typically limited to a short period in the morning. The start time is controlled by subsurface illumination levels, which are determined by sun angle and locally variable factors, such as light attenuation by the water column, rather than surface reflection or subsurface shadowing. The end time is determined by sun glitter effects, which in this case study, are predictable from sun angle, camera field of view, and wind speed with an R2 value of 0.9554. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},
