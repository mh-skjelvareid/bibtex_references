abstract = {Biological fouling is a significant problem to the shipping industry causing significant increases in fuel, maintenance, and downtime costs. Environmental concerns associated with toxic antifouling coatings have led to studies on alternative methods of biofouling control. This paper provides a literature review on laboratory and sea trial studies, which have used acoustic techniques for biofouling control. To the best of the authors×³ knowledge, this is the first in depth literature review on this topic. Applications of the reviewed studies have included the inhibition of biofouling on vessel hulls and pipes and also treatment of ballast water. The studies have used transducers operating in the audio and ultrasonic frequency range and sparkers. Variations were found in these acoustic parameters, which were reported to provide inhibition. Some have reported that low ultrasonic frequencies (about 20kHz) may be optimal. The potential effect of marine life is considered. The use of ultrasonic frequencies for biofouling control appear to be more desirable than audio frequencies since they are outside the hearing range of most marine life. More studies are needed on this topic, which are well documented in terms of the parameters used and efficiency of the trials.},

abstract = {The dynamics of inertial cavitation bubbles produced by short pulses of high-intensity focused ultrasound near a rigid boundary are studied to get a better understanding of the role of jet formation and shock wave emission during bubble collapse in the therapeutic applications of ultrasound. The bubble dynamics are investigated by high-speed photography with up to 2 million frames/s and acoustic measurements, as well as by numerical calculations. The significant parameter of this study is the dimensionless stand-off, gamma, which is defined as the distance of the bubble centre at its maximum expansion scaled by the maximum bubble radius. High-speed photography is applied to observe the bubble motion and the velocity of the liquid jet formed during bubble collapse. Hydrophone measurements are used to determine the pressure and the duration of the shock wave emitted during bubble rebound. Calculations yield the variation with time of the bubble wall, the maximum velocity and the kinetic energy of the re-entrant jet. The comparisons between experimental and numerical data are favourable with regard to both shape history and translational motion of the bubble. The acoustic energy constitutes the largest individual amount in the energy balance of bubble collapse. The ratio of the shock wave energy, measured at 10 mm from the emission centre, to the cavitation bubble energy was 1:2.4 at gamma = 1.55 and 1:3.5 at gamma = 1. At this distance, the shock wave pressure ranges from 0.122 MPa, at gamma = 1, to 0.162 MPa, at gamma = 1.55, and the temporal duration at the half maximum level is 87 ns. The maximum jet velocity ranges from 27 m s(-1), at gamma = 1, to 36 m s(-1), at gamma = 1.55. For gamma < 1.2, the re-entrant jet can generate an impact pressure on the nearby boundary larger than 50 MPa. We discuss the implications of the results for the therapeutic applications of high-intensity focused ultrasound.},
