abstract = {Ocean Color remote sensing has a great importance in monitoring of aquatic environments. The number of optical imaging sensors onboard satellites has been increasing in the past decades, allowing to retrieve information about various water quality parameters of the world's oceans and inland waters. This is done by using various regression algorithms to retrieve water quality parameters from remotely sensed multi-spectral data for the given sensor and environment. There is a great number of such algorithms for estimating water quality parameters with different performances. Hence, choosing the most suitable model for a given purpose can be challenging. This is especially the fact for optically complex aquatic environments. In this paper, we present a concept to an Automatic Model Selection Algorithm (AMSA) aiming at determining the best model for a given matchup dataset. AMSA automatically chooses between regression models to estimate the parameter in interest. AMSA also determines the number and combination of features to use in order to obtain the best model. We show how AMSA can be built for a certain application. The example AMSA we present here is designed to estimate oceanic Chlorophyll-a for global and optically complex waters by using four Machine Learning (ML) feature ranking methods and three ML regression models. We use a synthetic and two real matchup datasets to find the best models. Finally, we use two images from optically complex waters to illustrate the predictive power of the best models. Our results indicate that AMSA has a great potential to be used for operational purposes. It can be a useful objective tool for finding the most suitable model for a given sensor, water quality parameter and environment.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates state-of-the-art parametric and nonparametric approaches for the estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index, and fractional vegetation cover from space. The parametric approach involves comparison of established and generic narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) and the Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve method, which calculates the continuum spectral region sensitive to Chl. However, as not all available bands take part in these spectral algorithms, it remains unclear whether optimal estimations are achieved. Alternatively, the nonparametric approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) techniques and allows inclusion of all bands. GP builds a nonlinear regression as a linear combination of spectra mapped to a high-dimensional space. Moreover, GP provides an indication of the most contributing bands for each parameter, a weight for the most relevant spectra contained in the training data set, and a confidence estimate of the retrieval. GP has previously demonstrated to be competitive in accuracy with support vector regression and neural networks. Results from hyperspectral Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data over the Spanish Barrax test site show that GP outperformed the VIs in assessing the vegetation properties when using at least four out of the 62 bands. GP identified most contributing bands in the red and red edge and, to a lower extent, in the blue and NIR parts of the spectrum. Since the proposed GP method is able to build robust relationships between the parameter of interest and only a few bands, it is a promising approach for multispectral data as well. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Blix2018a,
abstract = {This paper evaluates two alternative regression techniques for oceanic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content estimation. One of the investigated methodologies is the recently introduced Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. We explore two feature ranking methods derived for the GPR model, namely sensitivity analysis (SA) and automatic relevance determination (ARD). We also investigate a second regression method, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) for oceanic Chl-a content estimation. Feature relevance in the PLSR model can be accessed through the variable importance in projection (VIP) feature ranking algorithm. This paper thus analyzes three feature ranking models, SA, ARD, and VIP, which are all derived from different fundamental principles, and uses the ranked features as inputs to the GPR and PLSR to assess regression strengths. We compare the regression performances using some common performance measures, and show how the feature ranking methods can be used to find the lowest number of features to estimate oceanic Chl-a content by using the GPR and PLSR models, while still producing comparable performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms. We evaluate the models on a global MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer matchup dataset. Our results show that the GPR model has the best regression performance for most of the input feature sets we used, and our conclusion is this model can favorably be used for Chl-a content retrieval, already with two features, ranked by either the SA or ARD methods.},

abstract = {Precise and spatially-explicit knowledge of leaf chlorophyll content (Chl) is crucial to adequately interpret the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) signal from space. Accompanying information about the reliability of the Chl estimation becomes more important than ever. Recently, a new statistical method was proposed within the family of nonparametric Bayesian statistics, namely Gaussian Processes regression (GPR). GPR is simpler and more robust than their machine learning family members while maintaining very good numerical performance and stability. Other features include: i) GPR requires a relatively small training data set and can adopt very flexible kernels, ii) GPR identifies the relevant bands and observations in establishing relationships with a variable, and finally iii) along with pixelwise estimations GPR provides accompanying confidence intervals. We used GPR to retrieve Chl from hyperspectral reflectance data and evaluated the portability of the regression model to other images. Based on field Chl measurements from the SPARC dataset and corresponding spaceborne CHRIS spectra (acquired in 2003, Barrax, Spain), GPR developed a regression model that was excellently validated (r2: 0.96, RMSE: 3.82 \mu{\rm g/cm}2 ). The SPARC-trained GPR model was subsequently applied to CHRIS images (Barrax, 2003, 2009) and airborne CASI flightlines (Barrax 2009) to generate Chl maps. The accompanying confidence maps provided insight in the robustness of the retrievals. Similar confidences were achieved by both sensors, which is encouraging for upscaling Chl estimates from field to landscape scale. Because of its robustness and ability to deliver confidence intervals, GPR is evaluated as a promising candidate for implementation into ChF processing chains. {\textcopyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Pasolli2010,
abstract = {In this letter, we explore the effectiveness of a novel regression method in the context of the estimation of biophysical parameters from remotely sensed imagery as an alternative to state-of-the-art regression methods like those based on artificial neural networks and support vector machines. This method, called Gaussian process (GP) regression, formulates the learning of the regressor within a Bayesian framework, where the regression model is derived by assuming the model variables follow a Gaussian prior distribution encoding the prior knowledge about the output function. One of its interesting properties, which gives it a key advantage over state-of-the-art regression methods, is the possibility to tune the free parameters of the model in an automatic way. Experiments were focused on the problem of estimating chlorophyll concentration in subsurface waters. The achieved results suggest that the GP regression method is very promising from both viewpoints of estimation accuracy and free parameter tuning. Moreover, it handles particularly well the problem of limited availability of training samples, typically encountered in biophysical parameter estimation applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},
